# Neural Distribution Invention Research Plan

## 1. What We're Trying to Achieve

### Core Goal
Develop neural networks that can **invent new distributions** rather than merely interpolate within their training distribution - mimicking how humans create "pocket realities" with modified rules to explore novel ideas.

### Specific Objectives
1. **Distribution Construction**: Build models that can create coherent new probability distributions with selectively modified constraints
2. **Controlled Extrapolation**: Enable networks to make principled explorations of the "adjacent possible" - ideas just outside their training boundary
3. **Rule Modification**: Develop architectures that can identify, modify, and consistently apply rule changes across a generated distribution
4. **Insight Transfer**: Create mechanisms for mapping insights from invented distributions back to the base distribution

### Success Metrics
- Models can generate novel but coherent outputs when asked to modify specific constraints
- Performance degrades gracefully (not catastrophically) as we move from training distribution
- Generated distributions maintain internal consistency while violating specified rules
- Human evaluators find the novel outputs "surprisingly sensible" and useful

## 2. How We're Going to Achieve It

### Technical Approach

#### A. Architecture Components
1. **Causal Disentanglement Module**
   - Separates causal mechanisms from parameters
   - Learns which rules can be modified independently
   - Uses attention mechanisms to identify constraint dependencies

2. **Distribution Generator Network**
   - Takes base distribution + modification request
   - Outputs parameters for a new coherent distribution
   - Uses hierarchical latent spaces for different abstraction levels

3. **Consistency Enforcer**
   - Ensures non-modified rules remain intact
   - Uses energy-based formulation with adjustable constraints
   - Trained adversarially against a "distribution critic"

4. **Insight Extractor**
   - Maps patterns from generated distribution back to base
   - Identifies which findings generalize vs. which are artifact-specific

#### B. Training Strategy
1. **Phase 1: Learn Base Distributions**
   - Train on standard datasets to learn rule extraction
   - Use reconstruction tasks to ensure rule completeness

2. **Phase 2: Controlled Modification**
   - Synthetic tasks with known rule modifications
   - Train to maintain consistency while changing specific rules

3. **Phase 3: Creative Generation**
   - Open-ended modification requests
   - Reward novel-but-coherent outputs
   - Use human feedback for quality assessment

#### C. Implementation Framework
```python
# Core Keras model structure
class DistributionInventor(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        self.rule_extractor = CausalRuleExtractor()
        self.modifier = SelectiveRuleModifier()
        self.generator = DistributionGenerator()
        self.consistency_checker = ConsistencyNetwork()
        self.insight_mapper = InsightExtractor()
```

## 4. Where We Will Perform Experiments

### Development Environment
- **Local (Mac)**: Initial prototyping, small-scale tests, architecture design
- **Google Colab (Free/Pro)**: Quick experiments, leveraging free GPU hours
- **Paperspace Gradient**: Main development, longer training runs

### Compute Allocation by Experiment

#### Phase 1: Prototyping (Local + Colab Free)
- Experiments 1-2 initial versions
- Small models (<10M parameters)
- Proof of concept implementations

#### Phase 2: Scaling (Paperspace Core)
- **Recommended**: P4000 ($0.51/hr) or P5000 ($0.78/hr)
- Experiments 1-4 full scale
- Models up to 100M parameters
- ~100 hours/month = $50-80/month

#### Phase 3: Advanced Training (Paperspace Pro)
- **Recommended**: A4000 ($0.76/hr) or A5000 ($1.38/hr)
- Experiments 5-6 + best model refinement
- Models up to 1B parameters
- ~200 hours/month = $150-280/month

### Infrastructure Setup

3. **Checkpoint Frequently**: Resume from checkpoints to use spot instances
4. **Profile First**: Use free Colab to profile before committing to paid runs

### Monitoring & Logging

import wandb

wandb.init(
    project="distribution-invention",
    config={
        "experiment": experiment_name,
        "modification_strength": 0.1,
        "consistency_weight": 1.0
    }
)

# Custom metrics
wandb.log({
    "distribution_distance": dist_metric,
    "consistency_score": consistency,
    "novelty_measure": novelty,
    "human_rating": rating
})
```

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Set up development environment, implement basic `DistributionGenerator` class
2. **Week 2**: Create physics simulation environment, begin Experiment 1
3. **Week 3**: Implement evaluation metrics, run first training experiments
4. **Week 4**: Analyze results, refine approach, plan Experiment 2

## Success Criteria

By the end of 4 months, we should have:
1. At least 3 working methods for distribution invention
2. Demonstrated success on 4+ different domains
3. A paper-worthy finding about how to make NNs think outside their distribution
4. Open-source codebase that others can build upon

This research could fundamentally change how we think about neural network creativity and generalization.
