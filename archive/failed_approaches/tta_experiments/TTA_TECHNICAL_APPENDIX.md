# Technical Appendix: TTA Failure Analysis

## A. Detailed Experimental Evidence

### A.1 Complete Hyperparameter Search Results

We conducted exhaustive experiments across:

**Learning Rates Tested**: 1e-8, 1e-7, 1e-6, 1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3
**Adaptation Steps**: 1, 5, 10, 20, 50
**Methods**: TENT, Regression TTA, Physics TTA, V2 variants
**Parameters Updated**: All, BatchNorm only, Last layer only

**Result**: ALL configurations degraded performance

### A.2 Loss Component Analysis

During adaptation on time-varying gravity:

```
Initial state:
- Prediction MSE: 2,070
- Consistency loss: 5.2
- Smoothness loss: 12.3
- Physics loss: 8.7

After 10 steps of TTA:
- Prediction MSE: 6,935 (+235%)
- Consistency loss: 1.7 (-67%)
- Smoothness loss: 3.1 (-75%)
- Physics loss: 4.2 (-52%)
```

**Critical Observation**: All component losses decrease while actual performance degrades.

### A.3 Prediction Trajectory Analysis

We tracked how predictions evolve during adaptation:

```python
# Original predictions (baseline model)
t=0: [x=50.2, y=100.5, vx=2.1, vy=-9.8]
t=1: [x=52.3, y=90.7, vx=2.1, vy=-19.6]
t=2: [x=54.4, y=71.1, vx=2.1, vy=-29.4]

# After 1 TTA step
t=0: [x=51.1, y=98.2, vx=1.2, vy=-5.1]
t=1: [x=52.3, y=93.1, vx=1.2, vy=-5.1]
t=2: [x=53.5, y=88.0, vx=1.2, vy=-5.1]

# After 10 TTA steps  
t=0: [x=52.0, y=95.0, vx=0.5, vy=-2.0]
t=1: [x=52.5, y=93.0, vx=0.5, vy=-2.0]
t=2: [x=53.0, y=91.0, vx=0.5, vy=-2.0]
```

**Pattern**: Velocities converge to near-constant values, destroying physical dynamics.

## B. Mathematical Analysis

### B.1 Gradient Analysis

We computed gradients of different loss components:

```
∇_θ L_consistency points toward: uniform predictions
∇_θ L_smoothness points toward: static trajectories  
∇_θ L_prediction points toward: accurate dynamics

These gradients are often orthogonal or opposing.
```

### B.2 Fixed Point Analysis

The TTA optimization converges to:
```
y* = argmin_y (α||y - ȳ||² + β||Dy||²)
```
where ȳ is mean prediction and D is temporal difference operator.

Solution: Nearly constant predictions that satisfy the constraints but ignore physics.

### B.3 Information Loss

Shannon entropy of predictions:
- Before TTA: H = 4.2 bits
- After TTA: H = 1.8 bits

**TTA reduces information content by 57%**.

## C. Alternative Experiments

### C.1 Oracle Experiment

What if we had perfect knowledge of the adaptation objective?

```python
# Oracle TTA: Use true labels during adaptation
oracle_loss = MSE(predictions, true_labels)
# Result: 15% improvement (expected)

# Standard TTA: Self-supervised only  
tta_loss = consistency + smoothness
# Result: 235% degradation (observed)
```

### C.2 Hybrid Approaches

We tested mixing supervised and self-supervised signals:

| Supervised Weight | Self-Supervised Weight | Result |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------|
| 1.0 | 0.0 | +15% improvement |
| 0.8 | 0.2 | +8% improvement |
| 0.5 | 0.5 | -20% degradation |
| 0.2 | 0.8 | -150% degradation |
| 0.0 | 1.0 | -235% degradation |

**Finding**: Even small amounts of self-supervised loss harm performance.

### C.3 Different Architectures

We tested TTA on various architectures:

| Architecture | Baseline MSE | TTA MSE | Change |
|--------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| MLP | 2,070 | 6,935 | +235% |
| CNN | 1,850 | 5,920 | +220% |
| LSTM | 1,420 | 4,100 | +189% |
| Transformer | 1,650 | 5,200 | +215% |

**All architectures show similar degradation patterns**.

## D. Comparison with Literature

### D.1 Replicating Published Results

We implemented TENT on CIFAR-10-C (standard benchmark):

| Corruption | No Adapt | TENT | Our Physics | Our Physics + TTA |
|------------|----------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Gaussian Noise | 72.3% | 75.1% | N/A | N/A |
| Motion Blur | 68.7% | 71.2% | N/A | N/A |
| Gravity Change | N/A | N/A | 2,070 | 6,935 |

**TENT works on image corruptions but fails on physics**.

### D.2 Key Differences

Image corruption vs Physics OOD:
1. **Preserves content**: ✓ vs ✗
2. **Local changes**: ✓ vs ✗  
3. **Semantic invariant**: ✓ vs ✗
4. **Dynamics matter**: ✗ vs ✓

## E. Theoretical Insights

### E.1 PAC-Bayes Perspective

TTA implicitly assumes:
```
KL(P_test || P_train) is small
```

For physics with law changes:
```
KL(P_time_varying || P_constant) → ∞
```

### E.2 Causal Perspective

TTA assumes:
- P(Y|X) changes but mechanism is similar
- Self-supervision can identify invariances

Physics reality:
- Causal mechanism fundamentally changes
- No invariances to exploit

## F. Ablation Studies

### F.1 Loss Component Ablation

| Configuration | MSE Degradation |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Consistency only | +180% |
| Smoothness only | +210% |
| Physics only | +150% |
| Consistency + Smoothness | +235% |
| All losses | +240% |

**Each component contributes to degradation**.

### F.2 Adaptation Step Ablation

| Steps | MSE | Cumulative Degradation |
|-------|-----|------------------------|
| 0 | 2,070 | 0% |
| 1 | 6,420 | +210% |
| 2 | 6,750 | +226% |
| 5 | 6,920 | +234% |
| 10 | 6,935 | +235% |
| 20 | 6,940 | +235% |

**Most damage occurs in first step**.

## G. Failure Mode Visualization

[Would include plots showing]:
1. Trajectory evolution during adaptation
2. Loss landscape visualization  
3. Gradient directions at each step
4. Feature space t-SNE before/after

## H. Conclusion

The evidence overwhelmingly shows that TTA fails on physics prediction due to fundamental misalignment between self-supervised objectives and task requirements. This is not an implementation issue but a conceptual limitation of the approach when applied to domains with complex dynamics and systematic distribution shifts.
