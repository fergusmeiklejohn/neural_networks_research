# Next Steps: TensorFlow Backend Training for PINN

## Overview

We're switching from JAX to TensorFlow backend for training our Physics-Informed Neural Network. This will enable full gradient-based training with our existing code.

## Why This Approach

1. **Immediate Functionality**: Our `train_pinn_extractor.py` script already has proper TensorFlow-style training with GradientTape - it will work without modification

2. **Focus on Science**: We can focus on whether PINNs solve our 0% extrapolation problem rather than debugging training infrastructure

3. **Proven Pipeline**: TensorFlow + Keras is battle-tested for exactly this type of progressive curriculum training

## Implementation Plan for Tomorrow

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# On cloud machine (Paperspace/Colab/AWS)
export KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]  # For GPU support
```

### Step 2: Verify GPU Access
```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(f"GPUs available: {tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')}")
```

### Step 3: Run Training
```bash
cd experiments/01_physics_worlds
python train_pinn_extractor.py
```

## What to Look Out For

### 1. **Memory Management**
- **Issue**: Our dataset is 400MB+ and loads entirely into memory
- **Watch for**: OOM (Out of Memory) errors
- **Solution**: 
  ```python
  # Add to script if needed
  gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
  if gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
  ```

### 2. **Training Progression**
Monitor these metrics across the 4 stages:

**Stage 1 (In-Distribution)**
- Trajectory loss should decrease steadily
- Physics loss should be 0 (disabled)
- Baseline performance establishment

**Stage 2 (Physics Introduction)**
- Trajectory loss might increase slightly (competing objectives)
- Physics loss should start decreasing
- Watch for instability - if losses explode, reduce physics weights

**Stage 3 (Domain Randomization)**
- Both losses should stabilize
- Validation loss on near-distribution data is key
- This tests generalization

**Stage 4 (Extrapolation Fine-tuning)**
- Focus on boundary cases
- May see some overfitting - that's okay for final push

### 3. **Key Metrics to Track**

```
Epoch 10/50
Train Loss: 0.2341 (should decrease)
Val Loss: 0.2567 (should follow train loss)
Physics Loss Components:
  - Energy Conservation: 0.0234 (target: <0.01)
  - Momentum Conservation: 0.0156 (target: <0.01)
  - Trajectory Smoothness: 0.0412 (lower is better)
```

### 4. **Red Flags**
- Loss becomes NaN → Learning rate too high or gradient explosion
- Val loss diverges from train → Overfitting (normal in Stage 4)
- Physics loss dominates → Reduce physics weights
- Training stalls → Check if stage transition happened

## Expected Timeline

- **Setup**: 30 minutes
- **Training**: 6-12 hours (50 epochs × 4 stages)
- **Evaluation**: 1 hour

## Success Criteria

After training completes, run evaluation:
```bash
python evaluate_pinn_performance.py
```

Look for:
1. **Energy Conservation Error**: <1% throughout trajectories
2. **Extrapolation Accuracy**: >70% (up from 0%!)
3. **Novel Parameter Success**: >60% on extreme physics

## Checkpointing

The script saves checkpoints after each stage:
- `outputs/checkpoints/pinn_in_distribution_epoch_45.keras`
- `outputs/checkpoints/pinn_physics_introduction_epoch_45.keras`
- etc.

If training interrupts, you can resume from these.

## Why We Expect This to Work

Our current 0% extrapolation accuracy happens because the transformer memorizes patterns without understanding physics. The PINN approach forces the model to:

1. **Learn Conservation Laws**: Energy can't be created/destroyed
2. **Respect Continuity**: Smooth trajectories via soft collisions
3. **Generalize Physics**: Laws that work at gravity=-1000 also work at gravity=-1500

The progressive curriculum is crucial - jumping straight to physics constraints would prevent learning. By gradually introducing physics, we get the best of both worlds: pattern recognition AND physical understanding.

## Tomorrow's Checklist

- [ ] Set up cloud GPU instance
- [ ] Install TensorFlow with GPU support
- [ ] Copy code and data to cloud
- [ ] Set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
- [ ] Run small test batch first
- [ ] Launch full training
- [ ] Monitor metrics via wandb/tensorboard
- [ ] Run evaluation after completion

## Final Note

This is the moment of truth for our distribution invention hypothesis. If PINNs achieve >70% extrapolation (from 0%), it proves that encoding domain knowledge (physics) enables true extrapolation beyond training data - a key step toward AGI-like generalization.
