# Minimal PINN Training Status

## Training Started Successfully

**Date**: 2025-01-15

### Initial Results
- Model initialized with 5,060 parameters (minimal architecture)
- Successfully loaded 3,218 training trajectories (2-ball only)
- Found 30 Jupiter-like gravity samples in test set

### Initial Performance (Before Training)
- test_interpolation: MSE=31,107.68
- test_extrapolation: MSE=32,721.40
- test_novel: MSE=38,377.00
- **test_jupiter: MSE=42,633.17** (target to beat: GraphExtrap's 0.766)

### Training Progress
- Training started successfully with progressive curriculum
- Loss decreasing from ~500M+ to ~600M range
- Using physics-aware features and F=ma base with corrections

### Key Observations
1. Initial MSE is very high (42,633 vs target 0.766)
2. Model correctly predicts Earth gravity (-9.8) initially
3. Physics losses are being computed (energy, angular momentum, smoothness)
4. Training is stable but slow convergence

### Environment Issue
Training may be interrupted due to conda environment access issues. If training stops, user should run:
```bash
conda activate dist-invention
cd experiments/01_physics_worlds
python train_minimal_pinn.py
```

### Next Steps If Training Completes
1. Check if final Jupiter MSE < 0.766 (GraphExtrap baseline)
2. Analyze learned physics parameters
3. Examine physics loss components
4. Compare with failed PINN results

### Alternative Actions While Waiting
1. Analyze GraphExtrap implementation to understand its success
2. Check baseline training data to see if it includes multiple gravities
3. Prepare true OOD benchmark implementation
