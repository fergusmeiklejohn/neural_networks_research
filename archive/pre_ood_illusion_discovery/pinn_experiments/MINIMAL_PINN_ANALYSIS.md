# Minimal PINN Analysis: Complete Failure

## Training Details
- **Training stopped**: Epoch 11/50 of Stage 1 (Earth/Mars only)
- **Final MSE on Jupiter**: 42,532.14
- **Learned gravity**: -9.81 m/sÂ² (stuck at Earth value)
- **Parameters**: 5,060

## Why It Failed So Badly

### 1. Early Stopping, No Adaptation
- Only completed 11 epochs of Stage 1
- Never saw Moon or Jupiter data
- Stuck predicting Earth gravity for everything

### 2. Compared to Full Training (from July 14)
Previous full training that reached Stage 3:
- Stage 1 (Earth/Mars): 1,220 MSE
- Stage 2 (+Moon): 874 MSE
- Stage 3 (+Jupiter): 880 MSE

Our minimal PINN:
- Stage 1 (partial): **42,532 MSE**
- 48x worse than previous Stage 1!

### 3. Architecture Issues
Despite improvements:
- Physics-aware features (polar coordinates)
- F=ma base with corrections
- Better loss weighting

The model still completely fails because:
- Physics constraints are too rigid
- Can't learn to modify gravity parameter
- Corrections are too small (0.1x scaling)

## Key Insight

**Even with all our improvements, the Minimal PINN performs worse than the original failed PINN!**

This suggests:
1. The progressive curriculum is essential
2. More training epochs are critical
3. The architecture may still be fundamentally flawed

## Comparison with Baselines

| Model | Jupiter MSE | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| GraphExtrap | 0.766 | Uses geometric features, likely diverse training |
| GFlowNet | 2,229 | Exploration helps but not enough |
| MAML | 3,298 | Adaptation helps but limited |
| Minimal PINN | **42,532** | Physics constraints prevent learning |

## Conclusion

The Minimal PINN's catastrophic failure (55,000x worse than GraphExtrap) proves that:
1. **Physics constraints can hurt more than help**
2. **Without diverse training data, models can't extrapolate**
3. **Current physics-informed approaches are fundamentally limited**

The path forward requires rethinking how we incorporate physics knowledge - not as rigid constraints but as modifiable, learnable structures.
