# Research Diary - July 27, 2025

## Session Overview: From Literature Review to Action Plan

Today's session focused on analyzing the comprehensive literature review (2023-2025) on compositional generalization and OOD, mapping these findings to our OOD Illusion discovery, and creating an actionable research plan.

## Key Activities

### 1. Literature Analysis
Thoroughly analyzed the research document covering latest developments in:
- Fundamental computational capabilities (variable binding)
- Architectural innovations for OOD generalization
- Hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches
- Evaluation methodologies
- Meta-learning for structural adaptation

### 2. Key Insights Discovered

#### Variable Binding is THE Missing Primitive
- Lewis et al. (2024): Even CLIP fails at basic variable binding
- Wu et al. (2025): Transformers CAN learn binding with proper training
- Without binding, our SCAN models couldn't modify rules (0% performance)

#### Explicit Structure Beats Complexity
- NSR achieved >90% on SCAN using symbolic parsing
- Our complex architectures (V2 gating) made things worse (4.2% vs 84.3%)
- Modular approaches enable exponential generalization

#### Most "OOD" is Actually Interpolation
- Li et al. (2025) validates our finding: 91.7% of "OOD" was interpolation
- Convex hull analysis reveals the truth about generalization claims
- Need mechanism-based evaluation, not parameter variation

#### Meta-Learning Changes Everything
- MLC achieved human-level generalization through curriculum alone
- Meta-learning shapes HOW models learn, not just what they learn
- CAMEL shows interpretability and performance can coexist

### 3. Created Comprehensive Research Plan

#### Immediate Priorities (Week 1):
1. **Minimal Variable Binding Demo**: Implement explicit binding for SCAN
2. **Fix Evaluation**: Add convex hull analysis to verify true OOD
3. **NSR-Style Parser**: Build symbolic intermediate representation
4. **Simple Meta-Learning**: Test if curriculum helps even basic models

#### Longer-term Roadmap:
- Phase 1: Fix evaluation infrastructure
- Phase 2: Variable binding architecture  
- Phase 3: Hybrid neuro-symbolic system
- Phase 4: Modular physics architecture
- Phase 5: Meta-learning for distribution invention

## Key Files Created

1. `NEXT_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS.md` - Comprehensive research strategy
2. `IMMEDIATE_ACTION_PLAN.md` - Week 1 detailed implementation plan
3. `LITERATURE_TO_OOD_ILLUSION_MAPPING.md` - Direct connections between findings

## Critical Code Snippets for Next Session

### Variable Binding Implementation
```python
class MinimalBindingModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.variable_memory = VariableMemory(n_slots=10)
        self.binder = BindingAttention()
        self.executor = BoundVariableExecutor()
```

### Convex Hull OOD Verification
```python
def verify_true_ood(train_data, test_data):
    hull = ConvexHull(train_embeddings)
    for point in test_embeddings:
        distance = distance_to_hull(point, hull)
        # Classify as interpolation/near/far extrapolation
```

### NSR-Style Symbolic Parser
```python
class NSRScanParser:
    def __init__(self):
        self.perception = nn.LSTM()  # Neural → Symbolic
        self.parser = SymbolicParser(grammar=SCAN_GRAMMAR)
        self.executor = SemanticExecutor()
```

## Next Session Starting Point

1. Begin with `experiments/03_binding_architecture/minimal_binding_scan.py`
2. Implement variable slots and binding mechanism
3. Create dereferencing training tasks
4. Test if explicit binding enables "jump" → "hop" modification

## Key Insight of the Day

**The OOD Illusion isn't just our discovery - it's a fundamental limitation exposed by multiple concurrent research efforts. The solution requires explicit computational primitives (binding), proper training (meta-learning), and honest evaluation (convex hull analysis).**

## Progress Metrics

- Literature review: ✓ Complete
- Architecture recommendations: ✓ Identified  
- Implementation plan: ✓ Created
- Next steps: ✓ Clear and actionable

The path forward is clear: implement variable binding, fix evaluation, and build toward true distribution invention through explicit structure rather than hoping emergence from complexity.
