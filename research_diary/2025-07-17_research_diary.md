# Research Diary - July 17, 2025

## Goals for Today
- Implement comprehensive Python code quality infrastructure to reduce debugging cycles

## What I Did

### Implemented Complete Code Quality Infrastructure
Created a comprehensive system to reduce Python debugging iterations from 5-10 to 1-2:

1. **Core Configuration Files**:
   - `pyproject.toml` - Central configuration for all Python tools
   - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Automated quality checks before commits
   - `.vscode/settings.json` - Real-time error detection for Cursor

2. **Centralized Utilities** (`utils/`):
   - `imports.py` - Eliminates scattered `sys.path.append` calls
   - `config.py` - Consistent environment configuration across platforms
   - `paths.py` - Cross-platform path resolution

3. **Testing Infrastructure** (`tests/`):
   - `conftest.py` - Shared pytest fixtures
   - Comprehensive tests for all utility modules
   - ~300 lines of tests per utility module

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Created `CODE_QUALITY_SETUP.md` - Complete guide to new infrastructure
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with new code patterns
   - Updated `CODE_RELIABILITY_GUIDE.md` with centralized utilities
   - Updated `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` with new infrastructure section

## Key Decisions and Rationale

1. **Chose mypy + Pylance** for type checking:
   - mypy for configuration flexibility and CI/CD
   - Pylance for real-time error detection in Cursor
   - Both can run simultaneously for comprehensive coverage

2. **Created centralized utilities** instead of fixing individual scripts:
   - One-time fix for all import/path/config issues
   - Consistent patterns across all experiments
   - Easier onboarding for new code

3. **Strict settings by default**:
   - Better to catch errors early than debug later
   - Can relax rules for specific modules if needed
   - Forces good practices from the start

## What Worked
- Pre-commit hooks configuration is comprehensive
- Utility modules are well-tested and documented
- Cursor settings provide excellent real-time feedback
- Documentation clearly explains benefits and usage

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Cursor uses .vscode directory (not Cursor-specific)
- **Solution**: Updated existing .vscode/settings.json - Cursor uses same format

## Results
- Created foundation for catching errors at development time
- Eliminated need for `sys.path.append` scattered throughout codebase
- Standardized configuration and path handling
- Set up automated quality enforcement

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: User should run `pip install -e ".[dev]"` and `pre-commit install`
2. **Gradual**: Add type hints to existing modules as they're modified
3. **Future**: Consider GitHub Actions for CI/CD with these tools

## Key Insights
- Most Python debugging cycles come from simple issues (imports, paths, types)
- Investing in infrastructure upfront saves massive time later
- Real-time error detection (Pylance) is game-changing for productivity
- Centralized utilities eliminate entire classes of errors

## Code Snippets for Tomorrow

### New standard script template:
```python
from utils.imports import setup_project_paths
setup_project_paths()

from utils.config import setup_environment
from utils.paths import get_data_path, get_output_path

config = setup_environment()
data_path = get_data_path("processed/physics_worlds")
```

### To run quality checks:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest tests/
```

## Files Created/Modified
- Created: `pyproject.toml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Created: `utils/` (imports.py, config.py, paths.py, __init__.py)
- Created: `tests/` (conftest.py, test_utils_*.py)
- Created: `CODE_QUALITY_SETUP.md`
- Updated: `.vscode/settings.json`, `.gitignore`
- Updated: `CLAUDE.md`, `CODE_RELIABILITY_GUIDE.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`

## Time Spent
~3 hours - Comprehensive implementation of code quality infrastructure
