# Research Diary - July 18, 2025

## Summary
Documentation cleanup day. Fixed misdated files from July 17th that were incorrectly labeled as July 19th. Updated project documentation to reflect accurate dates and current status. Now ready to make strategic decision about paper submission vs additional experiments.

## Major Activities

### 1. Documentation Cleanup ✅
**Fixed date inconsistencies across project**
- Renamed `2025-07-17_3_research_diary.md` to `2025-07-17_final_research_diary.md`
- Updated date headers from July 19 to July 17 in:
  - Research diary entry
  - `experiments/01_physics_worlds/CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- Identified need to update DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md

### 2. Project Status Assessment ✅
**Current state of OOD evaluation paper**
- Paper fully revised with k-NN analysis (96-97% interpolation rate)
- Second reviewer provided very positive assessment
- Ready for submission to NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR
- Complete markdown version available at `papers/ood_evaluation_analysis/ood_evaluation_analysis_complete.md`

### 3. Git Status Review ✅
**Identified cleanup needed**
- Deleted files to remove: old diary entries (2025-07-17, 18, 19)
- Untracked files to handle: diary entries 2025-07-17_1, 2, 3
- New PDF added: "Out-of-Distribution Evaluation in Physics.pdf"

## Key Decisions Needed

### Paper Submission Strategy
Need to decide between:

**Option A: Submit Now**
- Paper is review-ready with positive feedback
- Could target upcoming conference deadlines
- Allows moving to next research phase

**Option B: Strengthen with Experiments**
1. **Train Missing Baselines** (4-6 hours)
   - ERM and GraphExtrap for complete k-NN analysis
   - Command: `python train_baselines.py --models erm,graph_extrap`

2. **Incremental Coverage Ablation** (1 day)
   - Proves interpolation hypothesis definitively
   - Shows all architectures converge with coverage
   - Command: `python incremental_coverage_ablation.py`

## Technical Progress

### Files Modified
```

├── 2025-07-17_final_research_diary.md (renamed and date-corrected)
└── 2025-07-18_research_diary.md (this file)

└── CURRENT_STATUS.md (date corrections)
```

### Outstanding Tasks
1. Update DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md with correct latest diary date
2. Clean up git status (stage/commit changes)
3. Make paper submission decision
4. Execute chosen path

## Tomorrow's Priorities

### If Submitting Paper
1. Choose target conference (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR)
2. Prepare submission materials
3. Start next experiment or new paper

### If Running Experiments
1. Set up cloud compute (Paperspace)
2. Run missing baseline training
3. Start incremental coverage ablation
4. Update paper with new results

## Reflection

The date confusion highlights the importance of accurate documentation maintenance. When working intensively on revisions, it's easy to lose track of dates. Going forward:
- Always use actual date when creating diary entries
- Update "Last Updated" fields immediately
- Maintain consistency across all documentation

## Key Takeaway

**Project is at a crossroads**: We have a strong paper ready for submission, but could make it even stronger with additional experiments. The decision depends on:
- Conference deadline proximity
- Compute resource availability  
- Whether additional evidence would significantly strengthen the contribution

## Status Update

- **Documentation**: ✅ Dates fixed, cleanup in progress
- **Paper**: ✅ Fully revised and review-ready
- **Git**: ⏳ Needs cleanup (next task)
- **Decision**: ❓ Paper submission vs experiments
- **Next Step**: Complete git cleanup, then strategic decision

## Commands for Reference

View revised paper:
```bash
open papers/ood_evaluation_analysis/paper_for_review.html
cat papers/ood_evaluation_analysis/ood_evaluation_analysis_complete.md
```

Check baseline training status:
```bash
ls experiments/01_physics_worlds/outputs/models/
```

Run missing experiments:
```bash
cd experiments/01_physics_worlds
python train_baselines.py --models erm,graph_extrap --verbose
python incremental_coverage_ablation.py
```
