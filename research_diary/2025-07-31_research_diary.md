# Research Diary: July 31, 2025

## Summary
Major milestone achieved! Successfully implemented MLX-compatible sequential planning for the "then" operator and fixed the output interpretation issue that was causing incorrect predictions.

## Key Achievements

### 1. MLX-Compatible Sequential Planning ✅
- Overcame MLX autodiff limitations with "surgical fixes":
  - Replaced `put_along_axis` with continuous weighted sums
  - Fixed boolean indexing with masked computation  
  - Used soft attention instead of hard Gumbel-Softmax
- Achieved 100% training accuracy on sequential patterns
- Model successfully parses commands with "then" operator into segments
- Maintains memory state across sequential segments

### 2. Output Interpretation Fix ✅ 
- **Problem**: Original model output predictions for ALL token positions
- **Solution**: Created `SequentialModelWithActionTracking` with:
  - `ActionPositionTracker` to identify where actions should occur
  - Modified forward pass that only outputs at action positions
  - Structured output with action positions list
- **Result**: Clean, unambiguous predictions with correct shape

### 3. Technical Details

#### MLX Compatibility Fixes
Key insight: MLX autodiff cannot handle discrete operations, so we replaced them with continuous equivalents:

```python
# Original (problematic):
y_hard = mx.put_along_axis(y_hard, index, mx.array(1.0), axis=-1)

# MLX-compatible:
one_hot_binding = mx.where(
    mx.arange(self.num_slots) == slot_idx,
    1.0,
    mx.zeros((1, self.num_slots))
)
retrieved = (one_hot_binding[:, None, :] @ slot_values).squeeze(1)
```

#### Output Interpretation
Before: Model outputs shape (1, 14, 6) for 14 tokens when only 3 actions expected
After: Model outputs shape (1, 3, 6) for exactly 3 actions at positions [4, 4, 11]

## Current Status
- Sequential planning: ✅ Working
- MLX compatibility: ✅ Achieved  
- Output interpretation: ✅ Fixed
- Training accuracy: ✅ 100%
- Model saving: ❌ Still has `std::bad_cast` error (MLX limitation)

## Files Created/Modified
1. `train_sequential_planning_fixed.py` - MLX-compatible sequential model
2. `train_sequential_action_positions.py` - Improved model with action tracking
3. `test_output_interpretation_fix.py` - Demonstration of the fix
4. `OUTPUT_INTERPRETATION_FIX.md` - Documentation of the solution
5. `SEQUENTIAL_PLANNING_SUMMARY.md` - Updated with fix status

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Solve MLX model persistence** - Need workaround for `std::bad_cast` error
   - Try saving individual parameter arrays
   - Investigate pickle or custom serialization
   
2. **Compare with baselines** - Sequential planning vs original model
   - Run baseline models on sequential patterns
   - Quantify improvement on "then" operator tasks
   
3. **Add versioned memory** - Enable variable rebinding
   - Design memory versioning system
   - Handle "X means jump then X means walk" patterns

4. **Write up findings** - Prepare for publication
   - Document theoretical insights
   - Create figures showing compositional limits
   - Highlight MLX compatibility approach

## Key Insights
1. **MLX autodiff is restrictive but workable** - With creativity, we can replace discrete ops with continuous equivalents without sacrificing functionality
2. **Output structure matters** - Outputting at all positions creates ambiguity; targeted outputs at action positions provide clarity
3. **Sequential planning works** - The model successfully segments commands at "then" boundaries and maintains state

## Commands for Tomorrow
```bash
# Continue from model persistence issue:
cd experiments/03_binding_architecture
python debug_mlx_save.py  # Need to create this

# Test baseline comparison:
python compare_sequential_baseline.py  # Need to create this

# Key files to reference:
# - train_sequential_action_positions.py:L73-L122 (ActionPositionTracker)
# - train_sequential_action_positions.py:L124-L267 (process_segment_with_tracking)
```

## Open Questions
1. Can we save MLX models in chunks to avoid the `std::bad_cast` error?
2. How much does sequential planning improve over the baseline on "then" patterns?
3. What's the best approach for versioned memory to enable rebinding?

## Reflections
Today's work demonstrates the value of the "surgical fix" approach. Rather than abandoning MLX or oversimplifying the architecture, we carefully identified each problematic operation and replaced it with a continuous equivalent. The output interpretation fix shows how structural improvements can eliminate post-processing complexity. Both solutions maintain the full power of the architecture while working within framework constraints.
