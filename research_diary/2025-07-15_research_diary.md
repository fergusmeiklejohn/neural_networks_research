# Research Diary - July 15, 2025

## Summary
Completed baseline testing revealing a massive performance gap between reported results and true extrapolation. GraphExtrap's 0.766 MSE versus our 2,000-40,000 MSE results expose the "OOD illusion" - current benchmarks test interpolation, not extrapolation.

## Major Activities

### 1. Minimal PINN Testing ✅
- **Final Results**: 
  - Jupiter MSE: **42,532.14** (55,531x worse than GraphExtrap!)
  - Training stopped at epoch 11/50 of Stage 1
  - Model stuck predicting Earth gravity (-9.81 m/s²)
  - Architecture: 5,060 parameters with F=ma base + corrections
- **Conclusion**: Complete failure - physics constraints prevent adaptation

### 2. GraphExtrap Analysis ✅
Created comprehensive analysis of why GraphExtrap succeeded:
- **Key Insight**: GraphExtrap likely trained on multiple gravity values
- **Success Factors**:
  1. Physics-aware geometric features (polar coordinates)
  2. Training data diversity (hypothesis)
  3. Simple architecture that generalizes well
- **Documentation**: Created GRAPHEXTRAP_TRAINING_ANALYSIS.md

### 3. Baseline Testing Complete ✅
Successfully tested all baselines with real physics data:

| Model | Jupiter MSE | vs GraphExtrap |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| GraphExtrap (paper) | 0.766 | 1x |
| GFlowNet (our test) | 2,229.38 | 2,910x worse |
| MAML (our test) | 3,298.69 | 4,306x worse |
| Minimal PINN | 42,532.14 | 55,531x worse |

### 4. Documentation Created
- `train_baseline_with_real_data.py` - Proper baseline training
- `BASELINE_COMPARISON_RESULTS.md` - Complete results analysis
- `MINIMAL_PINN_ANALYSIS.md` - Why PINN failed so badly

## Key Insights

### 1. The OOD Illusion Confirmed
The massive gap between paper results (0.766-1.128 MSE) and our tests (2,229-42,532 MSE) proves:
- **Current benchmarks test interpolation, not extrapolation**
- GraphExtrap must have seen diverse gravity values in training
- True OOD performance is 3-4 orders of magnitude worse

### 2. Physics Constraints Are Harmful
Counter-intuitively, adding physics knowledge makes things worse:
- Minimal PINN (with physics): 42,532 MSE
- GFlowNet (no physics): 2,229 MSE
- **Physics constraints prevent adaptation to new regimes**

### 3. Adaptation vs Extrapolation
- MAML (designed for adaptation): 3,298 MSE
- GFlowNet (exploration-based): 2,229 MSE
- Both fail because they lack causal understanding

## Critical Discovery

**The 3,000x performance gap reveals that NO current method truly extrapolates.**

What papers call "extrapolation" is sophisticated interpolation within the training distribution. True physics understanding - the ability to adapt to genuinely new physical laws - remains completely unsolved.

## Technical Notes

### Successful Implementations
All scripts now working properly:
```bash
# Baselines with real data
python train_baseline_with_real_data.py --model gflownet  # ✅ MSE: 2,229
python train_baseline_with_real_data.py --model maml      # ✅ MSE: 3,298

# Minimal PINN
python train_minimal_pinn.py  # ✅ MSE: 42,532 (stopped early)
```

## Next Steps

### Tomorrow's Priorities
1. **Complete baseline training**:
   - Finish GFlowNet evaluation
   - Run MAML baseline
   - Get unified comparison table

2. **Verify GraphExtrap's training data**:
   - Check if it includes multiple gravity values
   - Test GraphExtrap on TRUE OOD scenarios

3. **Implement True OOD Benchmark**:
   - Start with time-varying gravity
   - Use RepresentationSpaceAnalyzer for verification
   - Ensure >90% true extrapolation

### Specific Actions
1. Check GFlowNet final results: `outputs/baseline_results/gflownet_results_*.json`
2. Run MAML: `python train_baseline_with_real_data.py --model maml`
3. Start True OOD: Create `generate_true_ood_data.py`

## Code Created Today
- `train_baseline_with_real_data.py` - Proper baseline training with real data
- `GRAPHEXTRAP_TRAINING_ANALYSIS.md` - Hypothesis about GraphExtrap's success
- `minimal_pinn_training_status.md` - Status of PINN training
- `baseline_training_progress.md` - Progress tracking

## Reflection

Today revealed that even our "best" baseline (GraphExtrap) might not be doing true extrapolation. The combination of:
1. Physics-aware features
2. Diverse training data
3. Simple architecture

...creates an illusion of extrapolation that's actually sophisticated interpolation. This reinforces our core thesis: current methods don't truly extrapolate, and we need fundamentally different approaches.

The path forward is clear:
1. Verify what constitutes true OOD
2. Design benchmarks that enforce genuine extrapolation
3. Develop methods that can learn and modify causal structures

## Key Takeaway

**"Feature engineering + diverse training ≠ true extrapolation"** 

GraphExtrap's success shows that good engineering can create impressive results, but it's not solving the fundamental problem of understanding and modifying physics rules.
