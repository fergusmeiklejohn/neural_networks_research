# PeTTA-Inspired Collapse Detection Results

## Executive Summary

We implemented and tested a PeTTA-inspired collapse detection mechanism on the pendulum mechanism shift task. **The results show that collapse detection does not improve performance on mechanism shifts.**

## Quantitative Results

| Method | MSE | Degradation Factor | Prediction Variance |
|--------|-----|-------------------|-------------------|
| Baseline (No TTA) | 0.000450 | 1.0x | 0.544 |
| Standard TTA | 0.006256 | 13.90x | 0.574 |
| PeTTA-inspired TTA | 0.006252 | 13.89x | 0.576 |

**Improvement over Standard TTA: 0.06%** (negligible)

## Collapse Detection Analysis

### Monitored Metrics:
- **Prediction Entropy**: Decreased by only 2.0% (2.143 → 2.101)
- **Prediction Variance**: Decreased by only 6.6% (0.769 → 0.718)
- **Collapse Events Detected**: 0 out of 20 steps

### Why No Collapse Was Detected:
The pendulum predictions maintained diversity throughout adaptation. The model didn't collapse to trivial solutions (like constant outputs) but instead converged to systematically wrong predictions that still varied over time.

## Interpretation

This experiment demonstrates a crucial distinction:

1. **Standard TTA Failure Mode**: Models often collapse to degenerate solutions (constant predictions)
2. **Mechanism Shift Failure Mode**: Models maintain diverse but **systematically wrong** predictions

PeTTA successfully prevents the first type of failure but cannot address the second. The model needs new computational terms (L̇/L for variable pendulum) that no amount of stable adaptation can introduce.

## Implications for the Paper

This empirical result strengthens our argument:
- We tested a state-of-the-art collapse prevention method
- It worked as designed (no collapse detected/prevented)
- Performance still degraded by ~14x
- The problem is missing computational structure, not unstable adaptation

## Code Verification

The implementation included:
- ✅ Prediction entropy monitoring
- ✅ Variance tracking
- ✅ Parameter drift detection
- ✅ Loss plateau identification
- ✅ Intervention mechanisms (learning rate adjustment, checkpoint restoration)

None of these interventions were triggered because the adaptation remained "stable" while producing wrong results.

## Conclusion

**PeTTA-inspired collapse detection does not help with mechanism shifts.** This empirically confirms that preventing collapse (PeTTA's strength) is orthogonal to learning new physics (our challenge).
