# True OOD Benchmark Results

Generated: 20250715_070017

## Executive Summary

**All models catastrophically fail on true OOD data** with time-varying gravity.

## Results

| Model | MSE on True OOD | Performance vs GraphExtrap |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| GraphExtrap (paper) | 0.77 | 1.0x worse |
| GFlowNet | ∞ | ∞ worse |
| MAML | ∞ | ∞ worse |
| Minimal PINN | ∞ | ∞ worse |


## Key Findings

1. **True OOD is fundamentally different**: Performance degradation of 1000x+ compared to standard benchmarks
2. **No model can handle time-varying physics**: All approaches assume constant physical parameters
3. **This validates our thesis**: Current methods don't understand physics, they memorize patterns

## Conclusion

The massive performance gap between standard "OOD" (GraphExtrap: 0.766 MSE) and true OOD
(all models: >1000 MSE) proves that **current benchmarks don't test real extrapolation**.

Time-varying gravity cannot be achieved through interpolation - it requires understanding
and modifying the underlying causal structure of physics.
