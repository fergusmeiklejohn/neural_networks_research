# Next Research Steps: Building on Our Findings

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Discovered Two Groundbreaking Findings
- **The OOD Illusion**: 91.7% of "far-OOD" samples are actually interpolation
- **PINN Catastrophic Failure**: Physics-informed model performed 1,150x worse than baseline

### 2. Understood Why GraphExtrap Succeeded
- Uses physics-aware geometric features (r, θ)
- Simple architecture with good inductive bias
- No complex loss balancing needed

### 3. Created Minimal PINN Architecture
- Starts with F=ma as base
- Adds small neural corrections
- Uses proper loss weighting (100x physics)
- Predicts accelerations, not positions

### 4. Documented Lessons Learned
- Feature representation > physics losses
- Architecture should encode physics
- Loss balance is critical
- Less is more

### 5. Designed True OOD Benchmark
- Representation-based verification
- Causal structure changes
- 4 difficulty levels
- >90% genuine extrapolation

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. Test Minimal PINN
```bash
python experiments/01_physics_worlds/train_minimal_pinn.py
```
- See if it beats GraphExtrap baseline
- Verify physics parameter learning
- Check energy conservation

### 2. Implement True OOD Benchmark
- Start with Level 2 (time-varying gravity)
- Verify samples are truly OOD
- Test all baselines on new benchmark

### 3. Write Paper 1: "The OOD Illusion"
**Structure:**
1. Introduction: OOD evaluation is broken
2. Method: Representation space analysis
3. Results: 91.7% of OOD is interpolation
4. Implications: Need better benchmarks
5. Solution: True OOD benchmark design

### 4. Write Paper 2: "When Physics-Informed Models Fail"
**Structure:**
1. Introduction: PINNs promise but underdeliver
2. Experiment: 1,150x worse than baseline
3. Analysis: Why explicit physics failed
4. Solution: Minimal PINN architecture
5. Lessons: Design principles for PINNs

## Medium-term Goals (Next Month)

### 1. Extend to Other Domains
- Apply representation analysis to other "OOD" benchmarks
- Test if OOD illusion is universal
- Create true OOD versions

### 2. Develop Hybrid Approach
- Combine symbolic physics with neural corrections
- Use program synthesis for rule extraction
- Test on increasingly complex physics

### 3. Scale Up Experiments
- Test on 3D physics
- Multi-body problems
- Fluid dynamics

### 4. Theoretical Analysis
- Why do models fail on interpolation?
- What makes extrapolation hard?
- Can we predict when models will fail?

## Long-term Vision (3-6 Months)

### 1. New Benchmark Suite
- True OOD benchmarks for multiple domains
- Standardized evaluation protocol
- Public leaderboard

### 2. New Architecture Family
- Physics-aware neural networks
- Guaranteed conservation properties
- Interpretable by design

### 3. Causal Learning Framework
- Learn causal structure from data
- Modify causal relationships
- Generate counterfactuals

## Key Research Questions

1. **Why do models fail on interpolation when the task requires causal understanding?**
2. **Can we design architectures that learn causality, not correlation?**
3. **What is the minimal inductive bias needed for physics learning?**
4. **How can we verify true extrapolation in any domain?**

## Conclusion

Our negative results revealed fundamental problems in how we evaluate and design physics-aware models. The path forward is clear:
1. Fix evaluation with true OOD benchmarks
2. Fix architectures with minimal physics-first design
3. Share findings to prevent others from same mistakes

The OOD illusion and PINN failure are not setbacks—they're breakthroughs in understanding what really matters for neural physics learning.
