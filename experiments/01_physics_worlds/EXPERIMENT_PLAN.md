### Phase 2: Model Training

**Phase 2 Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR REVISION COMPLETED** - Data Isolation Fixed

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Original results were invalid due to data leakage. Proper train/test isolation implemented.

**NEW CRITICAL INSIGHT** (from Materials OOD paper): Most "OOD" tasks are actually interpolation in representation space!

```
Data Isolation Fix Complete:
‚úì Identified fundamental data leakage problem in original approach
‚úì Implemented ImprovedPhysicsDataGenerator with proper train/test isolation
‚úì Created 6-way data split: train, val_in_dist, val_near_dist, test_interpolation, test_extrapolation, test_novel
‚úì Generated new datasets with no parameter overlap between train and test
‚úì Implemented DistributionInventionMetrics for proper evaluation
‚úì Enhanced model architecture for better extrapolation capability

Critical Update Needed:
‚ö†Ô∏è Must verify test sets are representationally OOD, not just statistically OOD
‚ö†Ô∏è Need UMAP analysis of learned representations to confirm true extrapolation
‚ö†Ô∏è Parameter encoding must capture physical relationships (not independent)

REVISED Component Performance (with proper isolation):
- Rule Extractor Accuracy: 0% on extrapolation (was 40.2% with data leakage)
- Interpolation Performance: 0% (proper baseline established)
- Novel Regime Performance: 0% (true distribution invention testing)
- Invention Score: 15% (mostly from modification consistency)

Key Insights:
- Original "good" performance was due to test data being statistically identical to training data
- True distribution invention is much harder than originally measured
- Need architectural improvements for extrapolation beyond training distribution
- Proper evaluation now distinguishes interpolation vs extrapolation vs novel regimes

Next Steps with Proper Isolation (Updated with Reviewer Feedback):
- [ ] **Implement Baseline Comparisons**: 
  - ERM + physics-aware data augmentation
