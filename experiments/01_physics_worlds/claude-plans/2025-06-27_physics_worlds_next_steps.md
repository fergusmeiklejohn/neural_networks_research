## Context
The Physics Worlds experiment has completed Phase 1 (data generation) and made significant progress on Phase 2 (model training). Most importantly, we've identified and fixed a critical data leakage issue that was making our original results scientifically invalid. With proper train/test isolation now in place, we see the true challenge: current performance on extrapolation is only 53% and novel regimes only 31.5%.

## Priority: Ensuring Scientific Validity
Our primary concern must be maintaining strict data isolation and avoiding any form of implicit knowledge transfer from training to test sets. This means:
- No hyperparameter tuning on test sets
- No architecture decisions based on test performance
- Strict separation of development/validation/test data
- Clear documentation of all data splits and their purposes

## 5 Key Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Complete Distribution Modification Component Training
**Goal**: Train the modification network that can apply rule changes to extracted physics parameters
**Tasks**:
- Load the existing improved datasets with modification pairs
- Implement a modification network that takes (physics_params, modification_request) â†’ modified_params
- Train on the 9,000 modification pairs already generated
- Evaluate modification consistency on held-out modification types
- Ensure the model can handle both numerical ("+20% gravity") and semantic ("underwater physics") requests

**Success Metrics**:
- Modification directional accuracy > 70%
- Magnitude consistency within 20% of target
- Semantic request understanding > 60%

### 2. Implement Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Components
**Goal**: Add physics-aware inductive biases to improve extrapolation
**Tasks**:
- Research PINN architectures suitable for trajectory prediction
- Implement energy conservation constraints in the loss function
- Add momentum conservation terms
- Create physics-consistency regularization
- Compare PINN-enhanced model with current transformer baseline

**Success Metrics**:
- Energy conservation violation < 10% on extrapolation set
- Improved trajectory smoothness scores
- Better parameter extraction accuracy, especially for gravity

### 3. Develop Progressive Training Curriculum
**Goal**: Train models to gradually extend from interpolation to extrapolation
**Tasks**:
- Create training curriculum that starts with in-distribution data
- Gradually introduce near-distribution samples
- Design curriculum scheduling (linear, exponential, or adaptive)
- Implement curriculum-aware training loop
- Track performance progression across distribution distances

**Success Metrics**:
- Monotonic improvement in near-distribution performance
- Better final extrapolation accuracy than direct training
- Reduced catastrophic forgetting on in-distribution data

### 4. Joint End-to-End Pipeline Training
**Goal**: Fine-tune the complete distribution invention pipeline
**Tasks**:
- Combine rule extractor + modifier + generator into single pipeline
- Design multi-objective loss function balancing:
  - Rule extraction accuracy
  - Modification consistency
  - Generation quality
  - Physics plausibility
- Implement gradient flow control between components
- Use validation sets to tune loss weights

**Success Metrics**:
- End-to-end modification success rate > 60%
- Maintained individual component performance
- Coherent physics in generated trajectories

### 5. Comprehensive Phase 3 Evaluation
**Goal**: Thoroughly evaluate distribution invention capabilities
**Tasks**:
- Run full evaluation on all 6 data splits
- Test all 11 modification types from test cases
- Generate trajectory visualizations and comparisons
- Compute distribution coverage metrics
- Document failure modes and success patterns
- Create final performance report

**Success Metrics**:
- Complete evaluation metrics for all test cases
- Identified patterns in successful vs failed modifications
- Clear understanding of model capabilities and limitations
- Recommendations for future improvements

## Implementation Timeline
- **Step 1**: 2-3 days (modification component)
- **Step 2**: 3-4 days (PINN implementation)
- **Step 3**: 2-3 days (progressive curriculum)
- **Step 4**: 3-4 days (joint training)
- **Step 5**: 2-3 days (comprehensive evaluation)

**Total**: ~2-3 weeks for complete implementation

## Risk Mitigation
1. **If PINN implementation is too complex**: Fall back to simpler physics-aware losses
2. **If joint training doesn't converge**: Train components separately with frozen parts
3. **If progressive curriculum doesn't help**: Focus on multi-task learning instead
4. **If modification component fails**: Simplify to numerical modifications only

## Key Principles to Maintain
1. **No test set peeking**: Never make decisions based on test performance
2. **Document everything**: Every experiment, hyperparameter, and result
3. **Validate incrementally**: Test each component before integration
4. **Maintain reproducibility**: Set random seeds, log all configs
5. **Think scientifically**: Question results, look for data leakage, validate assumptions

## Expected Outcomes
By completing these 5 steps, we expect to:
- Have a complete, properly evaluated distribution invention pipeline
- Understand the true capabilities and limitations of current approaches
- Identify specific areas where architectural innovations are needed
- Provide a solid foundation for the remaining 5 experiments in the research plan

## Notes
- Current best extrapolation accuracy: 53%
- Current novel regime success: 31.5%
- Target for success: >70% on both metrics
- This may require significant architectural innovations beyond these 5 steps
