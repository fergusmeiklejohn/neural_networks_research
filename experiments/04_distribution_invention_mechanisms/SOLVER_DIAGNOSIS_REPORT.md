## Critical Finding: V7 Solver Not Working

### Test Results
- **V7 Baseline**: 0% accuracy on 50 evaluation tasks
- **Hybrid V7+Imagination**: 0% accuracy (but generates reasonable hypotheses)
- **Issue**: V7 solver is not properly implementing transformations

### Specific Example: Task 00576224

**Input (2x2):**
```
[[3, 2],
 [7, 8]]
```

**Expected Output (6x6):**
```
[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2],
 [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8],
 [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3],  # Horizontally flipped
 [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7],  # Horizontally flipped
 [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2],
 [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]
```

**V7 Output (2x2):** ❌
```
[[3, 2],
 [7, 8]]
```
V7 returns the input unchanged despite detecting "tiling (scale: 3.0, 3.0)"

**Hybrid Output (6x6):** ❌ (but right size)
```
[[6, 4, 8, 6, 6, 4],
 [8, 6, 6, 4, 8, 6],
 ...random values...]
```
Hybrid at least generates 6x6 output through imagination

### Pattern Analysis

The correct transformation is:
1. **Horizontal scaling**: Repeat each row 3 times horizontally
2. **Vertical stacking**: Original → Flipped → Original
   - Rows 0-1: Original pattern repeated
   - Rows 2-3: Horizontally flipped pattern repeated
   - Rows 4-5: Original pattern repeated

This is a **position-dependent tiling pattern** - exactly what V5/V6 were designed to handle!

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. V7 Methods Not Returning Proper Outputs
- `try_simple_patterns()` returns confidence 0.0
- `try_position_dependent_tiling()` not working
- Falls back to TTA which just returns input unchanged

### 2. Missing DSL Primitives
The enhanced DSL has many primitives but lacks:
- `TileWithModification(pattern, modifications_per_tile)`
- `PositionDependentTile(pattern, position_rules)`

### 3. Synthesis Not Finding Solutions
- Program synthesis attempts but finds nothing
- Perception detects "tiling" but synthesis can't construct the program
- Need better primitive composition

### 4. Imagination Generates Wrong Values
- Structured imagination correctly identifies size constraint (6x6)
- But variations don't preserve the input values properly
- Need value-preserving transformations

## Why Previous Reports Showed 66.6% Accuracy

The 66.6% accuracy reported for V7 was likely from:
1. Different dataset (training vs evaluation)
2. Different test harness
3. Specific tasks that V7 could handle

Our current test on evaluation set shows the solver is fundamentally broken.

## Immediate Actions Needed

### Fix V7 Core Methods
1. Debug `try_position_dependent_tiling()` - should handle this case
2. Fix `ModifiedTilePattern` to actually work
3. Ensure TTA returns something reasonable, not just input

### Add Missing Variations to Imagination
1. **Tiling variations**: Simple tile, tile with flip, tile with rotation
2. **Value-preserving ops**: Operations that keep original values
3. **Position-dependent rules**: Different transformations per region

### Test on Training Set First
Before benchmarking on evaluation set, verify solvers work on training set where we know the patterns.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix V7 tiling implementation** (Priority 1)
2. **Add tiling variations to structured imagination** (Priority 2)
3. **Test on training set with known working examples** (Priority 3)
4. **Then re-run full benchmark** (Priority 4)

## Key Insight

The failure reveals that our "working" V7 solver has fundamental issues with even basic tiling patterns. The structured imagination framework is generating hypotheses but needs value-preserving transformations to maintain the semantic meaning of the input.

This is actually valuable - we've identified a clear, fixable issue rather than a vague performance problem.
