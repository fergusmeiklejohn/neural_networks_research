# Current Status: Distribution Invention Mechanisms

**Created**: August 4, 2025
**Status**: Active - Just created from breakthrough in variable binding

## Summary

We've just created this new experiment folder based on a major theoretical breakthrough: **variable binding IS distribution invention in miniature**. This reframes our entire research direction from solving a specific problem to understanding the fundamental mechanisms of creative extrapolation.

## What Led Us Here

1. **Experiment 03 (Variable Binding)** revealed that models plateau at ~50% because they try to interpolate rather than invent
2. **Memory Networks** failed because gradient descent can't learn discrete slot assignment
3. **Key Insight**: Distribution invention requires explicit, discrete, stateful operations

## Current Understanding

### Core Mechanisms Required
1. **Explicit Rule Extraction** - Can't be implicit in embeddings
2. **Discrete Modifications** - Some operations resist continuity
3. **State Tracking** - Must know "which distribution am I in?"
4. **Hybrid Processing** - Combine discrete and continuous

### Why This Matters
- Variable binding ("X means jump") creates a new distribution where X has meaning
- This is exactly what's needed for creative tasks like "imagine different physics"
- If we can't handle simple binding, we can't handle complex distribution invention

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Implement Two-Stage Compiler**:
   ```python
   Stage 1: Rule-based binding extraction (from compositional_final_fix.py)
   Stage 2: Neural execution with binding table
   ```

2. **Test on Progressive Complexity Dataset**:
   - We have 4 levels of test cases ready
   - Expect >90% accuracy with explicit approach

3. **Document Success and Extract Principles**:
   - What makes explicit better than implicit?
   - How much discreteness is necessary?
   - Can we make discrete operations differentiable?

## Files Ready to Use

- `progressive_complexity_dataset.py` - Test suite with 4 complexity levels
- `compositional_final_fix.py` - Working parser for Stage 1
- `compositional_operators.py` - Operator definitions
- `THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK.md` - Core insights about distribution invention
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed Two-Stage Compiler design

## How This Connects to Our Goals

This work directly addresses: "How can neural networks think outside their training distribution?"

By solving variable binding with explicit mechanisms, we're developing the building blocks for:
- Physics models that can explore different physical laws
- Vision models that can imagine novel concepts
- Mathematical models that can discover new structures

The journey from "X means jump" to "imagine different gravity" goes through understanding these minimal mechanisms.
