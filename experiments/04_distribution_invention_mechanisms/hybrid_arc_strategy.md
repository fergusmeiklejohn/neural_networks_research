# Hybrid ARC Strategy: Combining Distribution Invention with Benchmark Success

## Core Thesis
Our explicit extraction approach represents TRUE extrapolation capability - the ability to identify and modify rules rather than interpolate patterns. By combining this with minimal neural perception, we can achieve both:
1. Scientific advancement in distribution invention
2. Competitive performance on ARC-AGI benchmark

## Strategic Approach

### Phase 1: Fix Current Bottlenecks (Immediate)
**Goal**: Get our existing system fully functional

1. **Fix Pattern Discovery in TTA**
   - Current issue: `discovered_patterns: []` in evaluation
   - Root cause: `_refine_by_pattern_search` not finding patterns
   - Solution: Implement concrete pattern templates for ARC
   ```python
   # Add to arc_test_time_adapter.py
   arc_patterns = [
       "progression",      # 1->2->3->?
       "alternation",     # A->B->A->?
       "symmetry",        # Mirror patterns
       "periodicity",     # Repeating cycles
       "composition"      # f(g(x)) patterns
   ]
   ```

2. **Download Real ARC Dataset**
   - Use Kaggle API or direct download
   - 400 training + 400 evaluation tasks
   - Create proper data loader with caching

### Phase 2: Enhance Core Components (Week 1)
**Goal**: Strengthen both explicit and neural components

1. **Explicit Extraction Enhancements**
   - Add more transformation types:
     * Flood fill operations
     * Connectivity-based rules
     * Topological transformations
   - Implement rule composition algebra
   - Add temporal/sequential rule patterns

2. **Neural Perception Upgrades**
   - Use pretrained vision features (CLIP/DINOv2)
   - Implement proper object segmentation
   - Add spatial relationship detection
   - Include gestalt principles (closure, proximity)

### Phase 3: Build Evaluation Infrastructure (Week 2)
**Goal**: Systematic testing and comparison

1. **Comprehensive Benchmark Suite**
   ```python
   benchmarks = {
       "interpolation": [...],  # Within training distribution
       "near_extrapolation": [...],  # Just outside
       "true_ood": [...],  # Our novel compositions
       "arc_official": [...]  # Real ARC tasks
   }
   ```

2. **Ablation Studies**
   - Explicit only vs Neural only vs Hybrid
   - With/without TTA
   - Different ensemble weights
   - Various hypothesis generation strategies

### Phase 4: Novel Contributions (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Push boundaries while maintaining performance

1. **Distribution Invention for ARC**
   - Create "ARC-BEYOND" tasks that require true invention
   - Examples:
     * "Make rotation non-commutative" (AB â‰  BA)
     * "Add temporal dimension to grids"
     * "Create non-Euclidean grid transformations"

2. **Meta-Learning Integration**
   - Learn to extract extraction strategies
   - Adapt rule templates based on task distribution
   - Transfer learning from physics/math to visual domain

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate Actions (Today):
1. Fix pattern discovery (add concrete templates)
2. Download real ARC dataset
3. Run evaluation on 10 real ARC tasks

### This Week:
1. Implement enhanced object detection
2. Build proper evaluation pipeline
3. Create ablation study framework

### Next Steps:
1. Scale to full ARC dataset
2. Optimize ensemble weights
3. Submit to leaderboard (if competitive)

## Success Metrics

### Scientific Success:
- Demonstrate TRUE extrapolation (not interpolation)
- Show explicit rules outperform neural on OOD
- Publish novel theoretical insights

### Benchmark Success:
- >30% on ARC evaluation set (current SOTA: 55.5%)
- Strong performance on novel rule compositions
- Interpretable failure modes

## Key Differentiators

Our approach is unique because:
1. **Explicit extraction** - We extract symbolic rules, not learn patterns
2. **True OOD capability** - Can handle "multiplication is non-commutative"
3. **Compositional** - Rules combine algebraically
4. **Interpretable** - Can explain WHY a transformation was applied

## Risk Mitigation

1. **If pattern discovery remains broken**: Use enumeration of common patterns
2. **If explicit extraction underperforms**: Increase neural perception weight
3. **If TTA is too slow**: Pre-compute hypothesis space
4. **If accuracy plateaus**: Focus on specific task types first

## Experimental Design

```python
# Core experiment loop
for approach in ["explicit", "neural", "hybrid"]:
    for dataset in ["easy", "medium", "hard", "true_ood"]:
        for use_tta in [False, True]:
            results = evaluate(approach, dataset, use_tta)
            log_results(results)
```

## Next Immediate Step

Fix the pattern discovery issue - this is blocking everything else:

```python
# In arc_test_time_adapter.py, line ~150
def _refine_by_pattern_search(self, examples, rules):
    patterns = []

    # Add concrete ARC patterns
    for ex_in, ex_out in examples:
        # Check for progressions
        if self._is_progression(ex_in, ex_out):
            patterns.append(("progression", self._extract_progression))

        # Check for symmetries
        if self._is_symmetric(ex_in, ex_out):
            patterns.append(("symmetry", self._extract_symmetry))

        # Check for periodicities
        if self._is_periodic(ex_in, ex_out):
            patterns.append(("periodic", self._extract_period))

    return patterns
```

This gives us a concrete path forward that balances research innovation with benchmark performance.
