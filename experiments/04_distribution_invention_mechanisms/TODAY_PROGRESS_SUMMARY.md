# ARC-AGI Progress Summary - August 8, 2025

## Major Achievements Today

### 1. Comprehensive Failure Analysis ✅
- Analyzed 50 ARC-AGI tasks systematically
- Identified key failure modes:
  - **52% arithmetic failures** (color shifting, counting)
  - **44% conditional logic failures** (size/color/shape-based)
  - **4% spatial reasoning failures**
- Discovered top missing capabilities:
  - Spatial patterns (spiral: 42, repeating: 36 occurrences)
  - Conditional transformations (if_square: 29 occurrences)
  - Object counting/duplication (22 occurrences)

### 2. Enhanced Perception Module ✅
Created `enhanced_perception_v2.py` with detection for:
- **Arithmetic patterns**: Color shifts, count encoding, incremental sequences
- **Conditional logic**: Size-based, color-based, shape-based conditions
- **Spatial patterns**: Diagonal, spiral, border, repeating, symmetry
- **Structural changes**: Object merging, splitting, rearrangement

Key capabilities:
- Automatic pattern type determination
- Confidence scoring for detected patterns
- Comprehensive transformation analysis

### 3. Enhanced DSL with 18 New Primitives ✅
Created `arc_dsl_enhanced.py` based on failure analysis:

**Arithmetic Operations**:
- `AddConstant`: Shift all colors by fixed value
- `CountObjects`: Encode object count as color
- `MultiplyColors`: Scale color values
- `EnumerateObjects`: Sequential numbering

**Conditional Logic**:
- `IfSize`: Apply operations based on object size
- `IfColor`: Color-based conditional transformations
- `IfSquare`: Detect and transform square objects
- `IfLarge`: Fill large objects

**Spatial Patterns**:
- `DrawDiagonal`: Main/anti diagonal lines
- `DrawBorder`: Configurable border thickness
- `FillSpiral`: Spiral pattern filling
- `RepeatPattern`: Pattern tiling
- `MakeSymmetric`: Create symmetry

**Structural Operations**:
- `MergeAdjacent`: Combine touching objects
- `ConnectObjects`: Draw lines between objects
- `DuplicateNTimes`: Controlled duplication

## Key Insights from Analysis

### Why Our System Failed on 94% of Tasks
1. **Missing Arithmetic**: Tasks require color arithmetic we didn't support
2. **No Conditional Logic**: Many tasks use if-then rules based on object properties
3. **Spatial Pattern Blindness**: Couldn't detect/generate spirals, diagonals, borders
4. **Limited Structural Ops**: No merging, splitting, or connection operations

### Path Forward to 20-30% Accuracy

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. **Fix Search Strategy** ⏳
   - Program synthesis never triggers due to early stopping
   - Need adaptive confidence thresholds
   - Should try synthesis when object manipulation fails

2. **Neural Program Guide** ⏳
   - Use perception to guide program search
   - Prioritize primitives based on detected patterns
   - Learn from successful programs

3. **Test on Failed Tasks**
   - Re-evaluate the 50 analyzed tasks with new primitives
   - Measure improvement from enhanced DSL
   - Identify remaining gaps

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Perception Algorithm
```python
# Detects patterns across multiple categories
analysis = {
    "arithmetic_patterns": [color_shift, count_encoding],
    "conditional_patterns": [if_size, if_color, if_square],
    "spatial_patterns": [diagonal, spiral, border],
    "structural_patterns": [merge, split, rearrange]
}
```

### DSL Usage Example
```python
# Complex transformation: If square, fill with 5
if_square = IfSquare(then_color=5)
result = if_square.execute(grid)

# Spatial pattern: Draw border
border = DrawBorder(color=2, thickness=1)
result = border.execute(grid)
```

## Files Created Today
- `analyze_failed_arc_tasks.py` - Comprehensive failure analyzer
- `ARC_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed failure report
- `enhanced_perception_v2.py` - Advanced pattern detection
- `arc_dsl_enhanced.py` - 18 new DSL primitives
- `TODAY_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Validation Results
- Enhanced perception correctly identifies all tested patterns
- DSL primitives execute correctly on test cases
- Ready for integration into main solver

## Tomorrow's Priority
1. Fix search strategy to actually use program synthesis
2. Test enhanced system on the 50 failed tasks
3. Implement neural program guide for smarter search
4. Measure improvement and iterate

## Key Learning
**ARC tasks are highly structured** - they use specific patterns and transformations that can be catalogued. Our generic object manipulation failed because it didn't match ARC's actual transformation vocabulary. With targeted primitives based on real task analysis, we should see significant improvement.
