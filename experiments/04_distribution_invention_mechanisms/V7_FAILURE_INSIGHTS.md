# V7 Failure Analysis: Detailed Insights

## Executive Summary

V7 achieved 71.4% average accuracy and solved 1/8 tasks completely (08ed6ac7) using program synthesis. The remaining 7 tasks reveal critical gaps in our pattern recognition and learning systems.

## Failure Categories

### 1. Modified Tiling Pattern (007bbfb7)
**Accuracy: 70.4%**
- **Pattern**: 3x3 input tiles to 9x9 output with position-dependent modifications
- **Errors**: Primarily in the rightmost column of tiles (positions 6,8 in each row)
- **Root Cause**: Position-dependent rules not fully captured
- **Current Approach**: PositionDependentModifier learns some variations but misses column-specific patterns
- **Solution Needed**:
  - Enumerate all tile position rules explicitly
  - Or improve position-rule learning to handle column/row patterns

### 2. Near-Success Object Manipulation (>90% accuracy)

#### Task 00d62c1b (91.8%)
- **Pattern**: Add color 4 at specific positions relative to color 3 objects
- **Errors**: Missing 33 positions where color 4 should be added
- **Root Cause**: Spatial relationship rules not fully captured
- **Solution Needed**: Better object-relative position rules

#### Task 05f2a901 (94.5%)
- **Pattern**: Conditional object transformations based on color 2 and 8
- **Errors**: Only 6 positions wrong, all involving color 2
- **Root Cause**: Conditional logic slightly off
- **Solution Needed**: Fine-tune conditional rules or use local correction

### 3. Poor Performance Tasks (<50%)

#### Task 0a938d79 (44.8%)
- **Pattern**: Complex color-based object manipulation
- **Errors**: 164 positions wrong (widespread failure)
- **Root Cause**: Fundamental pattern not understood
- **Key Issue**: Colors in output don't match any simple mapping from input
- **Solution Needed**: New pattern type or better color relationship learning

#### Task 05269061 (22.4%)
- **Pattern**: Remove background (color 0) completely
- **Errors**: 38 positions, mostly outputting 0 where other colors expected
- **Root Cause**: Inverse of typical pattern (removing instead of preserving)
- **Solution Needed**: Background removal pattern type

### 4. Moderate Performance (60-80%)

#### Task 0d3d703e (66.7%)
- Fell back to TTA (Test-Time Adaptation)
- Object manipulation pattern not captured by deterministic methods

#### Task 0ca9ddb6 (80.2%)
- Also fell back to TTA
- Close to success but missing systematic pattern

## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. **Position-Dependent Rules in Tiling**
- Current: Basic tile-position learning
- Needed: Column/row-specific rule learning
- Example: "If tile is in column 3, apply transformation X"

### 2. **Object-Relative Positioning**
- Current: Basic object detection and manipulation
- Needed: Rules like "add color X at distance D from object Y"
- Critical for tasks with new colors appearing near existing objects

### 3. **Background Removal Patterns**
- Current: Focus on preserving/transforming foreground
- Needed: Explicit background removal operations
- Some tasks output only non-background colors

### 4. **Color Relationship Rules**
- Current: Simple color mappings
- Needed: Complex relationships like "color A becomes B if near C"
- Many failures involve unexpected color transformations

### 5. **Fine-Grained Corrections**
- Current: All-or-nothing pattern application
- Needed: Local error correction for near-perfect solutions
- Tasks at 90%+ could benefit from targeted fixes

## Synthesis Analysis

### Current Performance
- **Success Rate**: 1/8 tasks (12.5%)
- **Successful Task**: 08ed6ac7 (achieved 100%)
- **Typical Confidence**: 0.00 on early attempts

### Issues
1. **Poor Initial Perception**: Synthesis attempts with 0.00 confidence
2. **Limited Search Time**: 8-second timeout may be too short
3. **Weak Guidance**: Perception hints not effectively guiding search
4. **Missing Primitives**: DSL may lack necessary operations

### Improvements Needed
1. Better perception analysis before synthesis
2. Longer search times for complex patterns
3. Stronger perception-to-program mapping
4. Expanded DSL with position-dependent operations

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (High Impact)
1. **Implement Background Removal Pattern**
   - Add explicit "remove_background" operation
   - Would immediately help task 05269061

2. **Enhance Position Learning for Tiling**
   - Add column/row-specific rule learning
   - Would improve 007bbfb7 from 70% to potentially 100%

3. **Add Object-Relative Position Rules**
   - Implement "add_near_object" type operations
   - Would help 00d62c1b reach 100%

### Medium-Term
1. **Expand Program Synthesis DSL**
   - Add position-dependent operations
   - Include background/foreground operations
   - Add relative positioning primitives

2. **Implement Local Error Correction**
   - For solutions >85% accurate
   - Use small modifications to fix remaining errors

3. **Improve Perception-Synthesis Bridge**
   - Better feature extraction for synthesis
   - Stronger hints about likely operations

### Long-Term
1. **Learn New Pattern Types from Data**
   - Meta-learning to discover new pattern categories
   - Automatic DSL expansion based on failures

2. **Hierarchical Pattern Composition**
   - Combine multiple simple patterns
   - Build complex rules from primitives

## Conclusion

V7's main limitations are:
1. **Pattern Coverage**: Missing key pattern types (background removal, object-relative)
2. **Position Learning**: Not capturing column/row-specific rules in tiling
3. **Synthesis Guidance**: Poor perception-to-program mapping

Addressing these gaps could potentially solve 4-5 more tasks, bringing accuracy from 1/8 to 5-6/8 (62-75% task completion rate).
