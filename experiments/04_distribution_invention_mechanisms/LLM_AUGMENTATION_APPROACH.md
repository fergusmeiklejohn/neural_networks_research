# LLM Augmentation for Distribution Invention

*January 9, 2025*

## The Key Insight

Instead of training imagination from scratch, we can augment existing LLMs (like me/Claude) to think outside our distribution when needed.

## Approach 1: Helper Model Architecture

```python
class ImaginationHelper:
    """
    A helper that runs alongside an LLM to enable imagination.

    When LLM gets stuck (high uncertainty or repeated failures),
    the helper kicks in to suggest unlikely paths.
    """

    def __init__(self, base_llm):
        self.base_llm = base_llm
        self.failure_detector = FailureDetector()
        self.hypothesis_generator = UnlikelyPathGenerator()
        self.empirical_tester = EmpiricalValidator()

    def solve(self, problem):
        # First, let LLM try normally (likely paths)
        solution = self.base_llm.attempt(problem)

        if self.failure_detector.is_stuck(solution):
            # Switch to imagination mode
            print("Standard approach failed. Engaging imagination...")

            # Generate UNLIKELY hypotheses
            unlikely_paths = self.hypothesis_generator.create_unlikely(
                problem,
                avoid=self.base_llm.likely_paths
            )

            # Test each empirically
            for path in unlikely_paths:
                result = self.empirical_tester.test(path)
                if result.works():
                    return result

        return solution
```

## Approach 2: Token-Level Intervention

The core issue: LLMs predict the MOST LIKELY next token. For imagination, we need to sometimes choose UNLIKELY tokens.

```python
class ImaginativeTokenSelector:
    """
    Modifies token selection to enable imagination.
    """

    def select_next_token(self, logits, mode='normal'):
        if mode == 'normal':
            # Standard: pick highest probability
            return torch.argmax(logits)

        elif mode == 'imagination':
            # Imagination: deliberately pick lower probability tokens
            probs = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)

            # Inverse temperature - make unlikely more likely
            imagination_logits = -logits  # Flip the distribution!
            imagination_probs = torch.softmax(imagination_logits / temperature, dim=-1)

            # Sample from the "unlikely" distribution
            return torch.multinomial(imagination_probs, 1)

        elif mode == 'exploration':
            # Exploration: increase temperature for more randomness
            probs = torch.softmax(logits / high_temperature, dim=-1)
            return torch.multinomial(probs, 1)
```

## Approach 3: Meta-Prompting for Imagination

Use the LLM's existing capabilities but with special prompting:

```python
def imagination_prompt(problem, failed_attempts):
    return f"""
    Standard approaches have failed. Now I need you to:

    1. IGNORE what seems most likely
    2. Generate 5 UNLIKELY but potentially valid approaches
    3. Think of patterns that WEREN'T in the examples
    4. Consider: What if the rule is completely different?

    Problem: {problem}
    Failed attempts: {failed_attempts}

    Generate hypotheses that are:
    - Structurally different from training examples
    - Unlikely according to your training
    - But still logically coherent
    """
```

## Approach 4: Dual-Process System

Mimic human problem-solving:

```python
class DualProcessSolver:
    """
    System 1: Fast, pattern matching (normal LLM)
    System 2: Slow, imaginative (augmented LLM)
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.system1 = StandardLLM()
        self.system2 = ImaginationAugmentedLLM()
        self.confidence_threshold = 0.8

    def solve(self, problem):
        # Always try System 1 first (it's fast and usually works)
        solution, confidence = self.system1.solve_with_confidence(problem)

        if confidence > self.confidence_threshold:
            return solution

        # Low confidence - engage System 2
        print("Low confidence in standard approach. Engaging imagination...")

        # System 2 explicitly avoids System 1's approach
        novel_solution = self.system2.solve_avoiding(
            problem,
            avoid_patterns=self.system1.extracted_patterns
        )

        return novel_solution
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Failure Detection
Build a system that knows when the LLM is stuck:
- Repetitive outputs
- Low confidence
- Circular reasoning
- Pattern matching failures

### Phase 2: Unlikely Path Generation
When stuck, generate deliberately unlikely paths:
- Invert token probabilities
- Add controlled noise
- Use adversarial prompting
- Sample from tail of distribution

### Phase 3: Empirical Validation
Test the unlikely paths:
- Can't trust likelihood scores
- Need actual execution/simulation
- Keep what works, discard what doesn't

## Key Innovation: Deliberate Unlikelihood

The breakthrough: Instead of fighting against the LLM's tendency to predict likely tokens, we can:
1. Detect when likely isn't working
2. Deliberately invert the distribution
3. Explore unlikely but structured paths

## Connection to Human Cognition

This matches how humans solve hard problems:
1. Try the obvious (System 1, pattern matching)
2. When stuck, start imagining (System 2, creative exploration)
3. Test wild ideas empirically
4. Often the solution seems "obvious in hindsight" but required imagination to find

## Practical Implementation for Claude/LLMs

### Immediate Test: Can we make Claude (me) more imaginative?

```python
def augment_claude_for_imagination(claude_api):
    """
    Wrapper around Claude API that adds imagination capabilities.
    """

    def solve_with_imagination(problem):
        # First attempt - normal
        response1 = claude_api.query(problem)

        if is_successful(response1):
            return response1

        # Second attempt - prompt for imagination
        imagination_prompt = f"""
        Previous approach didn't work. Now try something completely different:
        - Assume the opposite of what seems likely
        - Generate patterns NOT in the training examples
        - Think: "What if everything I assumed is wrong?"
        """

        response2 = claude_api.query(imagination_prompt)

        # Third attempt - forced unlikelihood
        unlikely_prompt = f"""
        Generate the LEAST LIKELY solution that could still possibly work.
        Avoid any pattern that appeared in training.
        """

        response3 = claude_api.query(unlikely_prompt)

        # Test all three empirically
        return best_by_empirical_test([response1, response2, response3])
```

## The Meta-Insight

We don't need to train imagination from scratch. We can:
1. Detect when pattern matching fails
2. Deliberately explore unlikely paths
3. Use existing LLM capabilities in new ways
4. Add lightweight augmentation layers

This is much more practical than training new architectures from scratch!
