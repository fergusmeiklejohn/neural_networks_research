# ARC-AGI Enhancement Summary - August 8, 2025

## Morning: Systematic Failure Analysis & DSL Enhancement

### What We Did
1. **Analyzed 50 failed ARC tasks** to identify missing capabilities
2. **Created 18 new DSL primitives** based on failure patterns
3. **Fixed critical search bug** - program synthesis was never triggered
4. **Built enhanced perception** with 4 pattern categories

### Key Findings
- 52% failures due to missing arithmetic operations
- 44% failures due to missing conditional logic
- Spatial patterns (spirals, borders) appear in 84% of tasks
- Our "generic" object manipulation didn't match ARC's vocabulary

### Primitives Added
- **Arithmetic**: AddConstant, CountObjects, MultiplyColors, EnumerateObjects
- **Conditional**: IfSize, IfColor, IfSquare, IfLarge
- **Spatial**: DrawDiagonal, DrawBorder, FillSpiral, RepeatPattern, MakeSymmetric
- **Structural**: MergeAdjacent, ConnectObjects, DuplicateNTimes

## Afternoon: Testing & Pattern Discovery

### Major Discovery
**ARC uses pattern tiling, not simple scaling!**

Example (Task 007bbfb7):
- Input: 3x3 pattern
- Output: 9x9 grid with pattern repeated in each 3x3 tile
- BUT with modifications (context-dependent)

### Technical Fixes
1. Fixed program synthesis integration
2. Fixed TTA adapter argument mismatch
3. Added TilePattern primitive
4. Created evaluation scripts

### Current Status
- **Accuracy: 0% on real tasks** (still!)
- Pattern detection works but misidentifies transformations
- Synthesis never triggers (confidence thresholds too permissive)
- Need smarter search strategy

## Path Forward

### Immediate (Tomorrow)
1. **Adjust confidence thresholds** - force synthesis when size changes
2. **Add pattern composition** - how primitives combine
3. **Implement context-aware tiling** - handle modified tiles
4. **Run full evaluation** on 50 tasks

### Why We're Still at 0%
1. **Wrong pattern matching** - detecting diagonal when it's tiling
2. **Early stopping** - first high-confidence match stops search
3. **Missing compositions** - need primitive combinations
4. **Context blindness** - not considering size changes

### Key Insight
**ARC is about composition, not individual operations.** Tasks combine simple primitives in specific ways. Our approach is correct but needs:
- Better search (don't stop at first match)
- Primitive composition
- Context-aware pattern selection

## Estimated Progress
- **Yesterday**: 6% accuracy (baseline)
- **Today**: 0% (broken but fixable)
- **Tomorrow**: 15-20% (with fixes)
- **Target**: 20-30% (achievable)

The system architecture is sound. We have the right primitives. We just need smarter search and composition.
