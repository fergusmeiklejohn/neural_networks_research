# Next Steps Plan: From Insight to Implementation

*January 9, 2025*

## What We've Learned

1. **Core Insight**: Distribution invention requires imagining patterns not in training data
2. **Concrete Evidence**: Task 05269061 - correct solution scores poorly (0.304) on training but achieves 100% accuracy
3. **Key Challenge**: Neural networks are trained to maximize likelihood under training distribution - the opposite of what we need

## The Fundamental Problem

Our minimal imagination network revealed the core challenge:
- Traditional training (SGD + MSE loss) pushes toward training distribution
- Adding "diversity bonus" just creates noise, not structured imagination
- We need a fundamentally different training paradigm

## Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized)

### 1. Create a Proper Benchmark Suite
**Why first**: We can't improve what we can't measure

Create tasks that explicitly require imagination:
- Pattern A, B, C in training â†’ Pattern D (novel but related) in test
- Measure: Can model generate D? How many hypotheses does it try?
- Start with simple synthetic tasks, scale to ARC

### 2. Rethink the Training Paradigm
**Current approach fails because**:
- Gradient descent optimizes for likelihood
- We need to optimize for "successful novelty"

**Alternative approaches to explore**:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Reward for finding novel solutions
- **Meta-Learning**: Learn to learn new patterns quickly
- **Evolutionary Methods**: Population-based exploration
- **Contrastive Learning**: Learn what makes patterns different

### 3. Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Approach
**Why promising**: Combine strengths of both

- Neural: Pattern recognition, continuous optimization
- Symbolic: Discrete hypothesis generation, logical reasoning
- Bridge: Neural networks generate symbolic programs

This is what V7 started doing - maybe we should lean into it more

### 4. Study Biological Imagination
**Learn from nature**:
- How do humans imagine?
- Role of sleep/dreams in consolidation
- Hippocampal replay and pattern completion
- Default mode network and spontaneous thought

## Concrete Action Plan for Tomorrow

### Morning: Benchmark Development
1. Create 5 simple tasks that REQUIRE imagination
2. Implement metrics: novelty score, diversity, success rate
3. Test existing approaches (V7, V8) on these benchmarks

### Afternoon: Alternative Training Paradigm
1. Implement RL-based training for imagination network
2. Reward = (novelty * success) - (similarity to training)
3. See if this produces better imagination than supervised learning

### Evening: Theoretical Framework
1. Formalize the difference between interpolation and invention
2. Prove when imagination is necessary
3. Derive bounds on imagination-interpolation tradeoff

## Key Research Questions

1. **Is imagination learnable?** Or does it require explicit programming?
2. **What's the minimal architecture?** How simple can an imaginative system be?
3. **How do we evaluate imagination?** What metrics capture true novelty?
4. **Is there a no-free-lunch theorem?** More imagination = less accuracy?

## Wild Ideas Worth Trying

### "Dream Phase" Training
- Train normally during "wake" phase
- Generate wild hypotheses during "dream" phase
- Consolidate successful dreams into memory

### Adversarial Imagination
- Generator tries to create "impossible" solutions
- Discriminator tries to prove they won't work
- If discriminator fails, we found novel solution

### Quantum-Inspired Superposition
- Maintain multiple hypotheses in superposition
- Don't collapse until necessary
- Interference patterns guide exploration

## The Meta-Question

**Can we (systems trained on existing knowledge) create systems that transcend their training?**

This is the heart of the challenge. We're trying to break out of our own constraints while designing systems to break out of theirs.

## Success Criteria

We'll know we've succeeded when:
1. Our system solves problems that require patterns not in training
2. It does so systematically, not by luck
3. The mechanism is understandable and reproducible
4. It generalizes to multiple domains

## Next Immediate Task

Create the benchmark suite. Without proper evaluation, we're flying blind.

```python
# Start here tomorrow
create_imagination_benchmark.py
- Task 1: Pattern transformation (train on 3, test needs 4th)
- Task 2: Rule combination (train on A, B separately, test needs A+B)
- Task 3: Analogy making (train on domain X, test on domain Y)
- Task 4: Counterfactual reasoning (what if gravity went up?)
- Task 5: Creative problem solving (multiple valid novel solutions)
```

## Final Thought

We're not trying to build a better pattern matcher. We're trying to build a pattern inventor. This might require rethinking everything we know about neural network training.
