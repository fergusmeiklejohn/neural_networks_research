# Enhanced ARC System Findings - August 8, 2025

## Key Discovery: Pattern Tiling vs Scaling

### What We Found
While testing the enhanced solver, we discovered that many ARC tasks use **pattern tiling** rather than simple scaling:

**Example: Task 007bbfb7**
- Input: 3x3 grid with pattern
- Output: 9x9 grid
- NOT: Simple 3x scaling (zoom)
- ACTUALLY: The 3x3 pattern is repeated in each 3x3 cell of the 9x9 output

```
Input (3x3):        Output (9x9):
[0 7 7]            [0 0 0|0 7 7|0 7 7]  <- Input pattern repeated
[7 7 7]            [0 0 0|7 7 7|7 7 7]     in each 3x3 block
[0 7 7]            [0 0 0|0 7 7|0 7 7]
                   -------------------
                   [0 7 7|0 7 7|0 7 7]
                   [7 7 7|7 7 7|7 7 7]
                   [0 7 7|0 7 7|0 7 7]
                   -------------------
                   [0 0 0|0 7 7|0 7 7]
                   [0 0 0|7 7 7|7 7 7]
                   [0 0 0|0 7 7|0 7 7]
```

## System Performance Analysis

### Current Status
- **Accuracy: 0/5 (0%)** on real ARC tasks
- **All tasks using "simple" method** - synthesis never triggered
- **Pattern detection working** but misidentifying transformations

### Why The System Fails

1. **Missing Tiling Primitive**
   - We have `RepeatPattern` but it doesn't handle this specific tiling
   - Need a `TilePattern` that repeats input in NxN grid layout

2. **Confidence Thresholds Too Permissive**
   - Diagonal patterns detected with 0.9 confidence
   - System stops searching after finding high-confidence (but wrong) pattern
   - Should continue searching even with high-confidence patterns

3. **Program Synthesis Not Triggering**
   - Fixed the technical issues (beam_width, TTA adapter)
   - But confidence thresholds prevent it from running
   - Need to either:
     - Lower simple/object thresholds
     - Always try synthesis regardless
     - Use pattern complexity to adjust thresholds

## What's Working

1. **Pattern Detection**
   - Successfully detects arithmetic, spatial, conditional patterns
   - Confidence scoring works
   - All 4 pattern categories functional

2. **Enhanced DSL**
   - 18 new primitives compile and execute
   - Based on real failure analysis
   - Categories cover most ARC patterns

3. **Architecture**
   - Modular design allows easy primitive addition
   - Perception → DSL → Synthesis pipeline is sound
   - TTA fallback provides safety net

## Immediate Fixes Needed

### 1. Add Tiling Primitive
```python
class TilePattern(ARCPrimitive):
    """Tile input pattern in NxN grid."""
    def __init__(self, scale: int = 3):
        self.scale = scale

    def execute(self, grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        h, w = grid.shape
        output = np.zeros((h * self.scale, w * self.scale), dtype=grid.dtype)
        for i in range(self.scale):
            for j in range(self.scale):
                output[i*h:(i+1)*h, j*w:(j+1)*w] = grid
        return output
```

### 2. Adjust Search Strategy
- Always try synthesis if confidence < 0.95
- OR if pattern complexity > threshold
- OR if transformation involves size change

### 3. Improve Pattern Matching
- Check for size changes first
- If output size = N * input size, try tiling
- Use size ratio to guide pattern search

## Path Forward

### Short Term (Today)
1. ✅ Implement tiling primitive
2. ⏳ Adjust confidence thresholds
3. ⏳ Force synthesis on size-changing tasks
4. ⏳ Re-test on failed tasks

### Medium Term
1. Analyze patterns in remaining failures
2. Add missing primitives based on analysis
3. Implement smarter synthesis hints
4. Create pattern-specific solving strategies

### Long Term
1. Learn primitive selection from successful solutions
2. Build library of common ARC patterns
3. Implement meta-learning for pattern discovery
4. Scale to full 400+ task dataset

## Key Insight

**ARC tasks are highly compositional** - they combine simple operations in specific ways. Our approach of:
1. Analyzing failures
2. Building targeted primitives
3. Using perception to guide search

Is correct, but we need:
- More primitives (especially geometric transformations)
- Smarter search (don't stop at first high-confidence match)
- Better composition (how primitives combine)

The 6% → 20-30% improvement is achievable with these fixes.
