# Experiment 03: Variable Binding Architecture

## Objective
Implement minimal variable binding mechanism to enable true rule modifications in SCAN tasks, addressing the core limitation discovered in our previous experiments.

## Background
Our analysis revealed that models achieving 84.3% on SCAN were completely failing (0%) on actual modifications. The recent literature (Wu et al. 2025) shows that explicit variable binding through dereferencing tasks is essential for true compositional generalization.

## Key Hypothesis
Forcing models to perform explicit variable binding through dereferencing tasks will enable successful rule modifications where traditional architectures fail.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture (Days 1-2)
1. **VariableMemory**: Explicit slots for variable storage
2. **BindingAttention**: Associates words with memory slots
3. **BoundVariableExecutor**: Executes commands with bound variables

### Phase 2: Training Tasks (Day 2)
1. **Dereferencing Tasks**: Force binding through indirect reference
2. **Modification Tasks**: Test changing bound variables
3. **Compositional Tasks**: Combine multiple bindings

### Phase 3: Evaluation (Day 3)
1. Test on simple modifications (e.g., "jump" â†’ "hop")
2. Compare to baseline models
3. Analyze binding representations

## Success Criteria
- Model successfully binds words to variable slots
- Can modify bindings and execute with changes
- Achieves >50% accuracy on single-modification validation set
- Shows clear improvement over non-binding baselines

## Technical Details
- Based on Wu et al. (2025) transformer variable binding insights
- Uses explicit memory slots rather than distributed representations
- Forces dereferencing to ensure true binding occurs

## Expected Outcomes
- Proof that variable binding enables modifications
- Clear path to scaling up for full SCAN dataset
- Foundation for more complex rule modification tasks
