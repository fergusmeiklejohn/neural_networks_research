# Next Tasks Roadmap - Variable Binding Architecture

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-01  
**Current Status**: 4/5 major architectural limitations solved

## Completed Achievements ✅

1. **Dynamic Memory** - Solved contradictory optimization problem
2. **Temporal Action Buffer** - Handles "twice"/"thrice" patterns (100%)
3. **Sequential Planning** - Full "then" operator support (100%)
4. **Versioned Memory** - Variable rebinding capability (0% → 100%)

## Remaining Architectural Limitations

### 1. Compositional Operators ❌
**Problem**: Cannot handle "and", "while", "or" operators  
**Example**: "do X and Y twice" should do both X and Y, twice  
**Current**: Model treats these as regular tokens

### 2. Nested Temporal Patterns ❌
**Problem**: Cannot handle nested repetitions  
**Example**: "do X twice twice" should execute X four times  
**Current**: Only handles single-level temporal modifiers

## Priority Task List

### High Priority - Core Functionality

#### Task 1: Train Full Model with All Components
- Integrate versioned memory into main architecture
- Combine with sequential planning and temporal buffer
- Train on comprehensive dataset including rebinding patterns
- **Goal**: Single model with all capabilities

#### Task 2: Implement Compositional Operators
- Add "and" operator for parallel actions
- Add "while" operator for conditional loops
- Add "or" operator for choice/alternation
- **Approach**: Extend SequencePlanner to parse operators

#### Task 3: Solve Nested Temporal Patterns
- Enable recursive temporal modifier parsing
- Support patterns like "twice twice" → 4x
- Handle "do X twice then do Y thrice twice"
- **Approach**: Hierarchical temporal buffer

### Medium Priority - Evaluation & Analysis

#### Task 4: Comprehensive Evaluation Suite
- Test all architectural components together
- Create benchmark with complexity levels
- Compare against enhanced baselines
- Generate performance heatmap

#### Task 5: Theoretical Analysis
- Prove completeness of architecture
- Identify any remaining theoretical limits
- Formalize compositional capabilities
- Write mathematical framework

### Low Priority - Extensions

#### Task 6: Long-Range Dependencies
- Implement hierarchical attention
- Test on sequences >100 tokens
- Add memory compression/chunking

#### Task 7: Error Analysis
- Identify failure modes
- Create adversarial test cases
- Implement robustness improvements

## Implementation Order

```
Week 1:
- Day 1-2: Train integrated model (Task 1)
- Day 3-4: Implement "and" operator (Task 2.1)
- Day 5: Test and debug

Week 2:
- Day 1-2: Implement remaining operators (Task 2.2-2.3)
- Day 3-4: Solve nested patterns (Task 3)
- Day 5: Comprehensive evaluation (Task 4)

Week 3:
- Complete theoretical analysis
- Write paper sections
- Prepare for publication
```

## Success Criteria

1. **Integrated Model**: 100% on all current patterns PLUS rebinding
2. **Compositional Operators**: >90% on "and"/"or"/"while" patterns
3. **Nested Patterns**: >90% on recursive temporal modifiers
4. **Overall**: Pass all categories in comprehensive test suite

## Key Design Decisions

### For Compositional Operators
- Extend parser to build operator trees
- Execute operators in correct order (precedence)
- Maintain memory state across branches

### For Nested Patterns
- Recursive temporal buffer design
- Stack-based repetition tracking
- Compositional count calculation

## Files to Create/Modify

1. `train_integrated_model.py` - Combine all components
2. `compositional_operators.py` - Operator implementation
3. `nested_temporal_buffer.py` - Recursive patterns
4. `comprehensive_evaluation.py` - Full test suite
5. `theoretical_analysis.md` - Mathematical framework

## Research Questions

1. Is our architecture Turing-complete with operators?
2. What's the theoretical limit of compositional depth?
3. Can we learn operators from examples alone?
4. How does performance scale with pattern complexity?

## End Goal

A single model that can handle:
```
"X means jump and Y means walk do X and Y twice then 
 X means turn do X while Y means run do Y thrice twice"
```

With 100% accuracy, demonstrating true compositional generalization.
