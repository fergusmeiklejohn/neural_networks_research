# Current Status: Variable Binding Architecture

**Status**: Active - Core Implementation Complete
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-27

## Progress Summary
- ✓ Created experiment directory structure
- ✓ Implemented complete minimal binding architecture:
  - `VariableMemory`: Explicit slots for variable storage
  - `BindingAttention`: Associates words with memory slots
  - `BoundVariableExecutor`: Executes with bound variables
- ✓ Created dereferencing task generator with 5 task types:
  - Simple binding: "X means jump. Do X."
  - Multiple bindings: "X means jump. Y means walk. Do X then Y."
  - Rebinding: "X means jump. Do X. Now X means walk. Do X."
  - Compositional: "X means jump. Do X twice."
  - With modifiers: "X means turn. Do X left."
- ✓ Built complete training pipeline with modification testing
- ✓ Created test script to verify component integration

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Run quick test: `python test_binding_components.py`
2. Train model: `python train_binding_model.py` (50 epochs)
3. Analyze modification success rate
4. Compare to baseline models without binding

## Known Issues
- None identified yet

## Key Files
- `EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`: Overall experiment design
- `minimal_binding_scan.py`: Core binding model implementation
- `dereferencing_tasks.py`: Task generator forcing variable binding
- `train_binding_model.py`: Complete training pipeline
- `test_binding_components.py`: Quick integration test

## Notes
- This experiment directly addresses the 0% modification performance discovered in SCAN
- Uses dereferencing tasks to force explicit variable binding (Wu et al. 2025)
- Tests modification capability every 10 epochs during training
- Success criterion: >50% accuracy on single modifications
