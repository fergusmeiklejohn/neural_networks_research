"""Analyze the compositional parsing issue without imports."""

# The core issue: CompositionalParser creates parse trees where LEAF nodes
# contain entire command prefixes instead of just the execution targets.

# Example command: "X means jump Y means walk do X and Y"
# Current parsing result:
#   and[0:10]:
#     LEAF[0:8]: X means jump Y means walk do X
#     LEAF[9:10]: Y
#
# Desired parsing result:
#   and[6:10]:  # Starting from "do X and Y" part only
#     LEAF[7:8]: X
#     LEAF[9:10]: Y

# The problem is that CompositionalParser.parse() doesn't distinguish between:
# 1. Variable binding declarations (X means jump Y means walk)
# 2. Execution commands (do X and Y)

# Current parser logic (simplified):
# 1. Finds operator positions (e.g., 'and' at position 8)
# 2. Splits at operator: left=[0:8], right=[9:10]
# 3. Creates LEAF nodes with ALL tokens in each range

# What we need:
# 1. Pre-process to separate bindings from execution
# 2. Parse only the execution part for compositional structure
# 3. Keep bindings available for the executor

print("Problem Summary:")
print("- CompositionalParser includes variable bindings in LEAF nodes")
print("- This makes execution fail because 'X means jump Y means walk do X' != 'X'")
print("- The parser needs to isolate execution commands from bindings\n")

print("Current Behavior:")
print("Command: 'X means jump Y means walk do X and Y'")
print("Parse tree:")
print("  and[0:10]:")
print("    LEAF[0:8]: X means jump Y means walk do X")
print("    LEAF[9:10]: Y")
print("\nIssue: First LEAF contains entire binding + execution instead of just 'X'\n")

print("Needed Behavior:")
print("1. Extract bindings: {'X': 'jump', 'Y': 'walk'}")
print("2. Parse execution: 'do X and Y' -> and(X, Y)")
print("3. Execute with bindings: and(jump, walk)\n")

print("Solution Approaches:")
print("1. Two-phase parsing:")
print("   - Phase 1: Extract all 'VAR means ACTION' patterns")
print("   - Phase 2: Parse remaining execution commands")
print("\n2. Modified parser that tracks 'do' keyword:")
print("   - Only parse compositional structure after 'do'")
print("   - Keep track of binding context separately")
print("\n3. Preprocessing step:")
print("   - Split command at 'do' keyword")
print("   - Process bindings and execution separately")

print("\nNext Steps:")
print("1. Implement binding extraction logic")
print("2. Modify parser to handle execution-only commands")
print("3. Update executor to use extracted bindings")
print("4. Test on all compositional patterns")
