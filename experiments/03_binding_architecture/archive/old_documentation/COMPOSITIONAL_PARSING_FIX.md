# Compositional Parsing Fix

## Problem Identified

The compositional parser was including variable bindings in LEAF nodes, causing execution failures:

**Example**: `"X means jump Y means walk do X and Y"`

**Before Fix**:
```
and[0:10]:
  LEAF[0:8]: X means jump Y means walk do X  # ❌ Contains bindings
  LEAF[9:10]: Y
```

The first LEAF incorrectly contained `"X means jump Y means walk do X"` instead of just `"X"`.

## Root Cause

The `CompositionalParser` was parsing the entire token sequence without distinguishing between:
1. Variable binding declarations (`X means jump Y means walk`)
2. Execution commands (`do X and Y`)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Binding Extraction
```python
def extract_bindings(tokens: List[int]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Extract all 'VAR means ACTION' patterns before execution."""
```

### 2. Execution Isolation
```python
def parse_with_bindings(tokens: mx.array) -> Tuple[ParseNode, int]:
    """Parse only the execution part (after 'do' keyword)."""
```

### 3. Variable Resolution
```python
def resolve_compositional_command(tokens: List[int], bindings: Dict[str, str]) -> List[str]:
    """Resolve variables using extracted bindings."""
```

## Results

**After Fix**:
```
Command: X means jump Y means walk do X and Y
Bindings: {'X': 'jump', 'Y': 'walk'}
Execution part: X and Y
Parse tree:
  and:
    LEAF: X
    LEAF: Y
Result: ['JUMP', 'WALK'] ✓
```

## Test Results

All test cases now pass:
- ✓ Simple 'and' with two variables
- ✓ 'and' followed by 'then'
- ✓ Multiple 'and' operators
- ✓ Same variable used twice
- ✓ Direct actions without variables

## Implementation Files

1. `fix_compositional_standalone.py` - Standalone proof of concept
2. `test_compositional_fix.py` - Comprehensive test suite
3. `train_compositional_fixed_v2.py` - Full model implementation with fix

## Expected Impact

With this fix, compositional operator accuracy should improve from 63.9% to >90% as the model can now:
1. Correctly parse compositional structures
2. Properly resolve variables to actions
3. Execute complex compositional patterns

## Next Steps

1. Apply this fix to all training scripts
2. Re-train models to verify improved accuracy
3. Test on full compositional operator suite
