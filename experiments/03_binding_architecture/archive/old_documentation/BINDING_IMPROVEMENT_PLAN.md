# Variable Binding Architecture Improvement Plan

## Current Status

We have identified critical gaps between our simplified MLX implementation and the vision from Wu et al. (2025). The current model lacks:
- Explicit memory slots
- True variable dereferencing
- Modification capability
- Proper attention-based binding

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Proper Binding Architecture (`train_binding_mlx_proper.py`)
- **VariableMemory**: Explicit slots with content-based addressing
- **BindingAttention**: Multi-head attention for word-to-slot assignment
- **BoundVariableExecutor**: Uses retrieved slot values (not just embeddings)
- **Hard Binding**: Argmax for discrete slot assignments
- **Entropy Regularization**: Encourages diverse slot usage

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite (`test_binding_capabilities.py`)
Tests for:
- Basic dereferencing: "X means jump. Do X." → "JUMP"
- Rebinding: "X means jump. Now X means hop. Do X." → "HOP"
- Compositional: "X means jump. Do X twice." → "JUMP", "JUMP"
- Chained references: "X means Y. Y means jump. Do X." → "JUMP"

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete Core Implementation (Today)
1. **Run and Debug Proper Implementation**
   ```bash
   python train_binding_mlx_proper.py --quick
   ```
   - Fix any dimension mismatches
   - Ensure proper gradient flow
   - Verify slot retrieval mechanism works

2. **Implement Modification Support**
   - Add parsing for modification commands
   - Implement slot update mechanism
   - Test on rebinding scenarios

3. **Add LSTM/GRU for Sequential Processing**
   - Replace simple feedforward with recurrent layers
   - Handle variable-length sequences properly
   - Add cross-attention in executor

### Phase 2: Enhanced Architecture (Tomorrow)
1. **Implement Pointer Networks**
   - For handling chained references
   - Enable multi-hop reasoning

2. **Add Compositional Operators**
   - "twice", "then", "and" operators
   - Learnable composition functions

3. **Memory Persistence**
   - Maintain bindings across examples
   - Enable few-shot learning scenarios

### Phase 3: Integration & Evaluation
1. **SCAN Integration**
   - Adapt SCAN tasks for variable binding
   - Compare with baseline models
   - Measure true OOD performance

2. **Baseline Comparisons**
   - Test all 4 baseline models on binding tasks
   - Show that standard architectures fail
   - Demonstrate our approach succeeds

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile MLX operations
   - Optimize memory access patterns
   - Achieve >1M samples/sec inference

## Key Architectural Insights

### Why Explicit Slots Matter
Standard neural networks use distributed representations where information is spread across many neurons. This makes selective modification impossible - changing "jump" to "hop" affects all contexts where "jump" appears.

With explicit slots:
- Each variable gets a dedicated memory location
- Modifications only affect that specific slot
- Other bindings remain intact

### Hard vs Soft Binding
- **Soft binding** (weighted average): Allows gradient flow but creates interference
- **Hard binding** (argmax): Forces discrete assignments but blocks gradients
- **Solution**: Use soft scores for training, hard assignments for inference

### The Dereferencing Mechanism
The key operation is retrieving values from slots based on bindings:
```python
slot_indices = bindings[:, i]  # Which slot for each word
retrieved = slot_values[slot_indices]  # Get values from those slots
```

This explicit retrieval is what enables true variable manipulation.

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Goals
- [ ] 90%+ accuracy on basic dereferencing
- [ ] 80%+ accuracy on rebinding tasks
- [ ] 70%+ accuracy on compositional tasks
- [ ] <1ms inference latency per example

### Research Goals
- [ ] Demonstrate true OOD generalization via modifications
- [ ] Show failure of standard architectures on same tasks
- [ ] Publish results showing variable binding as key primitive

## Implementation Priority

1. **Get basic binding working** - Even 50% accuracy would validate approach
2. **Add modification support** - This is the key differentiator
3. **Optimize performance** - MLX should give us speed advantage
4. **Integrate with SCAN** - For paper-ready results

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Quick test of proper implementation
python train_binding_mlx_proper.py --quick

# Run comprehensive tests
python test_binding_capabilities.py

# Compare with simplified version
python train_binding_mlx_simple.py  # Should fail binding tests

# Full training run (after debugging)
python train_binding_mlx_proper.py --epochs 50 --lr 0.001
```

## Research Impact

This work addresses a fundamental limitation in current AI:
- **Current models**: Can only recombine training patterns
- **With binding**: Can manipulate abstract rules
- **Result**: True extrapolation and distribution invention

Success here would demonstrate that neural networks need explicit computational primitives (like variable binding) to achieve human-like generalization.
