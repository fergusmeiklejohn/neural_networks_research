# Compositional Operators Progress Update

## Status: Vocabulary Fix Implemented ✓

### What We Fixed
- **Root Cause Identified**: Compositional operators ('and', 'then', 'while', 'or') were not in VOCAB
- **Fix Applied**: Added operators to VOCAB before model/parser initialization
- **Result**: Parser now correctly creates parse trees instead of single leaf nodes

### Parsing Now Works
```
"do X and Y" → and(LEAF, LEAF) ✓
"do X then do Y" → then(LEAF, LEAF) ✓
"do X and Y then do Z" → and(LEAF, then(LEAF, LEAF)) ✓
```

### New Issue Discovered
The parser is grouping tokens incorrectly for commands with bindings:

**Example**: `"X means jump Y means walk do X and Y"`
- **Current parsing**: `and(LEAF[X means jump Y means walk do X], LEAF[Y])`
- **Problem**: All bindings and first execution are in one leaf
- **Expected**: Bindings should be processed separately from execution commands

### Current Accuracy
- Training: 63.91% (improved from 58.5%)
- Test: 42.9% (7 test cases)

### Next Steps
1. Improve parsing logic to handle binding/execution separation
2. Consider preprocessing commands to separate binding phase from execution phase
3. Or modify executor to handle complex leaf nodes with multiple bindings

## Key Learning
The vocabulary fix was necessary but not sufficient. The parser architecture assumes simpler command structures and needs enhancement for complex compositional commands with multiple bindings.
