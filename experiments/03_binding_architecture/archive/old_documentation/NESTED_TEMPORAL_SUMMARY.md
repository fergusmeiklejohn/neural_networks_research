# Nested Temporal Patterns Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented support for nested temporal patterns in the variable binding architecture. This allows the model to handle complex recursive temporal modifiers like "do X twice twice" (which executes X four times).

## Key Components

### 1. NestedTemporalParser
- Parses nested temporal modifiers from token sequences
- Builds hierarchical `TemporalNode` structures
- Supports arbitrary nesting depth (e.g., "twice twice twice")

### 2. NestedTemporalExecutor
- Executes parsed temporal patterns
- Recursively expands nested structures
- Integrates with variable bindings

### 3. TemporalNode Structure
```python
@dataclass
class TemporalNode:
    modifier: TemporalModifier  # TWICE (2), THRICE (3), ONCE (1)
    children: List['TemporalNode']  # For nested patterns
    base_action: Optional[str]  # For leaf nodes (e.g., 'X')
```

## Supported Patterns

1. **Simple Nesting**: "do X twice twice" → 4 repetitions
2. **Mixed Modifiers**: "do X thrice twice" → 6 repetitions (3 × 2)
3. **Deep Nesting**: "do X twice twice twice" → 8 repetitions (2 × 2 × 2)
4. **Sequential with Nested**: "do X twice twice then do Y thrice" → XXXX YYY

## Training Results

The simplified nested temporal model achieved **100% accuracy** on all test patterns:

```
Training complete! Best accuracy: 100.00%

Test Results:
- "X means jump do X twice" → ['JUMP', 'JUMP'] ✓
- "X means jump do X twice twice" → ['JUMP', 'JUMP', 'JUMP', 'JUMP'] ✓
- "X means walk do X thrice twice" → ['WALK'] × 6 ✓
- "X means turn do X twice twice twice" → ['TURN'] × 8 ✓
- "X means walk Y means jump do X twice twice then do Y thrice" → ['WALK'] × 4 + ['JUMP'] × 3 ✓
```

## Implementation Details

### Parsing Algorithm
The parser:
1. Identifies "do VARIABLE" patterns
2. Collects all following temporal modifiers
3. Builds nested structure from right to left (innermost to outermost)

Example: "do X twice thrice" creates:
```
THRICE x3 of:
  X x2
```

### Execution Algorithm
The executor:
1. Recursively expands temporal nodes
2. For leaf nodes: repeats the bound action N times
3. For parent nodes: repeats child sequence N times

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Right-to-Left Nesting**: Modifiers are applied from right to left, matching natural language interpretation
2. **Recursive Structure**: Uses tree representation for arbitrary nesting depth
3. **Integration with Existing Architecture**: Builds on Dynamic Memory and Temporal Action Buffer

## Files Created

1. `nested_temporal_patterns.py` - Core implementation
2. `train_nested_temporal_simple.py` - Simplified training script
3. `train_nested_temporal_model.py` - Full integration (needs refinement)

## Next Steps

1. Integrate nested temporal patterns with compositional operators
2. Handle edge cases (e.g., "do X twice and Y thrice twice")
3. Optimize for longer sequences and deeper nesting
