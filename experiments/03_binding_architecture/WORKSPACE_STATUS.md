# Current Status: Variable Binding as Distribution Invention

**Last Updated**: August 4, 2025
**Status**: Active - Major theoretical breakthrough achieved

## Executive Summary

We've discovered that variable binding (e.g., "X means jump") is actually **distribution invention in miniature**. This simple task reveals why neural networks struggle with true extrapolation: they try to interpolate when they need to invent.

## Key Breakthrough

**Variable binding IS distribution invention**:
- Base distribution: X has no meaning
- Invented distribution: X → jump
- This is exactly the operation needed for creative extrapolation

## What We've Learned

### 1. Why Models Plateau at 50%
- They treat binding as implicit (hidden states)
- Should be explicit rule modification
- Memory networks failed due to non-differentiable operations

### 2. Core Requirements Identified
Through experiments, we've identified what distribution invention needs:
- **Explicit rule extraction** (not implicit in embeddings)
- **Discrete modifications** (X → jump, not X ≈ 0.7*jump)
- **Temporal consistency** (rules persist until changed)
- **Compositional execution** (combine multiple rules)

### 3. Architecture Implications
- Standard transformers fundamentally can't do this
- Need hybrid discrete-continuous approaches
- Two-stage architectures look promising

## Current Results

### Memory Network Performance
- Level 1 (single binding): 100% ✅
- Level 2 (compositions): 40% ⚠️
- Level 3 (rebinding): 0% ❌
- Level 4 (complex): Mixed results

### Key Finding
Memory values stay at zero - the model bypasses memory entirely! This proves gradient descent can't learn discrete slot assignment.

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Implement Two-Stage Compiler (Recommended)
```python
Stage 1: Rule-based binding extraction (guaranteed correct)
Stage 2: Neural execution with binding table
Expected accuracy: 85-95%
```

### 2. Key Design Principles
- Make binding explicit, not emergent
- Separate discrete operations from continuous
- Maintain temporal state tracking

### 3. Research Questions to Explore
- How to make discrete operations differentiable?
- Can we discover (not just apply) rule modifications?
- How does this scale to physics/visual domains?

## The Big Picture

This work is revealing the **minimal cognitive operations** for distribution invention:
1. Identify modifiable rules
2. Apply discrete modifications
3. Maintain consistency
4. Track state changes

If we solve variable binding properly, we'll have the building blocks for true creative extrapolation in physics, vision, and beyond.

## How to Continue

When returning to this work:
1. Read `THEORETICAL_ANALYSIS_BINDING_AS_DISTRIBUTION_INVENTION.md` first
2. Implement Two-Stage Compiler in new file
3. Test on progressive complexity dataset
4. If >90% accuracy, start scaling principles to physics domain

The key insight: **Distribution invention requires explicit, discrete, stateful operations** - not just better interpolation.
