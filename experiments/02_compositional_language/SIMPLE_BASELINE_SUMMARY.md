# Simple Baseline Evaluation Summary

## Key Findings

### 1. Evaluation Illusion Confirmed ✓

The simple baseline model demonstrates the evaluation illusion perfectly:

- **Model trained**: Simple LSTM seq2seq (~267K parameters)
- **Training data**: Mixed base + modifications (10K examples, 2 epochs)
- **Training accuracy**: ~1.8% (very low due to minimal training)

### 2. Proper Evaluation Results

Using modification-aware validation sets:

```
val_base......................  0.00% (500 examples)
val_mod_walk_skip.............  0.00% (500 examples)
val_mod_jump_hop..............  0.00% (500 examples)
val_mod_look_scan.............  0.00% (500 examples)
val_mod_left_right............  0.00% (341 examples)
val_mod_mixed.................  0.00% (500 examples)
val_mod_unseen................  0.00% (500 examples)
val_mod_composed..............  0.00% (498 examples)
```

### 3. What This Reveals

1. **No Evaluation Illusion Here**: The model shows 0% on both base and modifications
   - This is actually GOOD - it's honest about its performance
   - Contrast with previous models showing 84.3% while failing on modifications

2. **Architecture Simplicity Works**:
   - No complex gating mechanisms
   - No separate rule extraction/modification components
   - Just a basic seq2seq model that either works or doesn't

3. **Training Insufficiency**:
   - 2 epochs with 10K examples is insufficient
   - Model hasn't learned even basic SCAN mappings yet
   - Needs longer training to establish meaningful baseline

## Comparison with Complex Models

| Model Type | Val Accuracy (Old) | True Performance | Architecture Complexity |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| V1 Standard | 84.3% | 0% on modifications | High (rule extraction + modification) |
| V2 Gated | 84.3% | 0% on modifications | Very High (gating + tf.cond logic) |
| Simple Baseline | 0% | 0% (honest) | Low (basic LSTM seq2seq) |

## Key Insights

1. **Honest Failure > Deceptive Success**: The simple baseline's 0% accuracy is more valuable than the complex models' misleading 84.3%

2. **Evaluation Sets Matter**: Using proper modification-specific validation immediately reveals true model capabilities

3. **Complexity ≠ Capability**: The complex architectures didn't help - they just made debugging harder

## Next Steps

1. **Train Longer**: Run simple baseline for 50+ epochs to establish true baseline performance
2. **Compare Fairly**: Once trained properly, compare:
   - Base accuracy
   - Modification accuracy
   - Performance drop
3. **Document Case Study**: Use this as concrete example of evaluation illusion in the paper

## Code Simplicity Benefits

The simple baseline is:
- Easier to debug
- Faster to train
- More predictable
- No architectural fragility
- Clear about what it can/cannot do

This demonstrates that starting simple and using proper evaluation is better than complex architectures with flawed evaluation.
