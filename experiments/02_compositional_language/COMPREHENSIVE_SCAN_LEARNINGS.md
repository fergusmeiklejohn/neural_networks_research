# Comprehensive SCAN Experiment Learnings

## Executive Summary

Our SCAN (Systematic Compositional Actions and Navigation) experiments revealed a fundamental flaw in how we evaluate neural networks for compositional generalization. Models achieving 84.3% validation accuracy were actually failing completely (0%) at their core task. This "Evaluation Illusion" has profound implications for the field.

## Timeline and Evolution

### Phase 1: Initial Complex Models (V1)
- **Architecture**: Transformer-based with explicit rule extraction and modification modules
- **Training**: Separate stages for base learning and modification adaptation
- **Initial Results**: 84.3% validation accuracy
- **Red Flags**: Training instability, complex debugging, unclear what model learned

### Phase 2: Refined Architecture (V2)
- **Changes**: Added gating mechanisms, more sophisticated modification layers
- **Hypothesis**: Better architectural inductive biases would improve generalization
- **Results**: Still 84.3% validation, same complete failure on modifications
- **Realization**: Architecture complexity wasn't the solution

### Phase 3: The Revelation
- **Discovery**: Created modification-specific validation sets
- **Shocking Results**: 0% accuracy on ALL modification types
- **The Illusion**: Standard validation was hiding complete failure
- **Key Insight**: Models weren't learning composition at all

### Phase 4: Simple Baseline Confirmation
- **Approach**: Basic LSTM seq2seq, no special mechanisms
- **Results**: 0% on everything (at least it's honest!)
- **Value**: Confirmed the task is genuinely hard, not just poorly evaluated

## Key Technical Learnings

### 1. The Evaluation Illusion Mechanism

Standard validation creates illusion through:
```python
# Training data: 50% base, 50% modifications (mixed)
train_data = base_examples + modification_examples

# Validation: Same distribution
val_data = base_examples + modification_examples

# Result: Model memorizes frequent patterns
# Appears to generalize (84.3%) but actually fails
```

Proper evaluation reveals truth:
```python
# Separate validation sets by capability
val_base_only = just_base_examples          # 0%
val_walk_skip = just_walk_skip_examples    # 0%
val_jump_hop = just_jump_hop_examples      # 0%
# ... etc
```

### 2. Architecture Complexity Trap

We fell into the classic ML trap:
1. Model fails → Add complexity
2. Still fails → Add more complexity
3. Validation looks good → Declare success
4. Reality: Complex architecture just better at gaming metrics

**Lesson**: Start simple, evaluate properly, then add complexity only if it helps on proper evaluation.

### 3. Data Distribution Insights

Critical discoveries about SCAN:
- **Not truly compositional**: Even "base" examples require implicit composition
- **Modification consistency**: Models must track which modification is active
- **Context sensitivity**: Same command means different things with different modifiers

### 4. Training Dynamics

Observed patterns across all models:
```
Epochs 1-10:   Rapid improvement on training loss
Epochs 10-30:  Validation plateaus around 80-85%
Epochs 30-50:  Overfitting or collapse
Generation:    Repetitive outputs ("I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT...")
```

This suggests models find local optima that satisfy training distribution but don't capture true task structure.

## Failed Approaches and Why

### 1. Staged Training
**Approach**: Train on base first, then modifications
**Why it failed**: Model overwrites base knowledge when learning modifications

### 2. Explicit Rule Extraction
**Approach**: Separate modules for rules and modifications
**Why it failed**: No guarantee extracted "rules" are compositional

### 3. Gating Mechanisms
**Approach**: Learn when to apply modifications
**Why it failed**: Gates learn spurious correlations, not true conditions

### 4. Curriculum Learning
**Approach**: Easy examples first, then harder
**Why it failed**: "Easy" and "hard" poorly defined without understanding task

## What Actually Works (Hints)

Through our failures, we discovered hints about what might work:

### 1. True Compositional Structure
Models need architecture that enforces composition:
```python
# Instead of: output = model(input)
# Consider:  output = compose(base_function, modifier_function)
```

### 2. Explicit Binding
Modifications must explicitly bind to actions:
```python
# Bad:  "jump twice" → model → "JUMP JUMP"
# Good: "jump twice" → bind(JUMP, twice) → execute(JUMP, 2)
```

### 3. Symbolic Intermediate Representations
Pure neural approaches struggle; hybrid neuro-symbolic might be necessary.

## Evaluation Best Practices

### 1. Capability-Specific Test Sets
```python
test_sets = {
    'base_only': examples_with_no_modifications,
    'mod_type_1_only': examples_with_only_modification_1,
    'mod_type_2_only': examples_with_only_modification_2,
    'novel_compositions': unseen_base_modifier_combinations
}
```

### 2. Generation Quality Tests
Don't just measure accuracy:
```python
# Check for degenerate outputs
generated = model.generate(input)
if all_tokens_same(generated):
    print("Model collapsed!")
```

### 3. Modification Consistency
Test if model maintains modifications:
```python
# If "walk → skip", then "walk twice → skip skip"
assert model("walk twice") == "SKIP SKIP"  # not "WALK WALK"
```

## Broader Implications

### 1. For SCAN Research
- Most published SCAN results may be evaluation illusions
- Need to re-evaluate with proper modification-aware splits
- Question whether SCAN tests composition or memorization

### 2. For Compositional Generalization
- Standard benchmarks insufficient
- Need tasks with verifiable compositional structure
- Consider moving to domains with clearer ground truth (physics, math)

### 3. For ML Evaluation
- Aggregate metrics hide capability gaps
- Always test claimed capabilities in isolation
- Simple baselines essential for calibration

## Recommendations for Future Work

### 1. Immediate Actions
- Re-run all SCAN experiments with proper evaluation
- Publish negative results to save others time
- Create better compositional benchmarks

### 2. Architecture Research
- Explore explicit compositional architectures
- Investigate program synthesis approaches
- Consider hybrid neuro-symbolic methods

### 3. Evaluation Standards
- Develop capability-specific evaluation protocols
- Create visualization tools for failure analysis
- Establish baselines for all new tasks

## Code Artifacts

Key files for understanding our journey:
```
models_v2.py              # Complex architecture (failed)
simple_baseline_v2.py     # Simple baseline (honestly failed)
evaluation_v2.py          # Proper evaluation framework
demonstrate_evaluation_illusion.py  # Minimal reproduction
```

## Philosophical Reflections

This journey taught us that:
1. **Failure is valuable**: Our "failed" models taught us more than successes would have
2. **Simplicity reveals truth**: Complex architectures can hide fundamental issues
3. **Metrics shape research**: Bad evaluation leads entire fields astray
4. **Honesty over accuracy**: A model that admits failure is better than one that pretends success

## Conclusion

The SCAN experiments were a masterclass in how evaluation practices can deceive us. While our models achieved 0% on their intended task, we achieved something more valuable: understanding of a fundamental problem in how we evaluate compositional generalization.

The path forward requires:
- Better evaluation practices
- Simpler baselines
- Honest reporting of failures
- New approaches to composition

Most importantly, we must always ask: "Is our model actually solving the task, or just gaming the metrics?"

This quote perfectly captures our SCAN journey. We thought we had 84.3% knowledge, but we had 0% understanding.
