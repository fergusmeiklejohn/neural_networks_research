# Compositional Language Experiment - Findings Summary
## Date: July 23, 2025

### Today's Objectives
1. Diagnose why the model showed catastrophic interference in Stages 2-4
2. Compare Stage 1 vs Stage 2 outputs to understand modification behavior
3. Implement architectural improvements to handle modifications better
4. Test mixed training strategy to prevent catastrophic forgetting

### Key Findings

#### 1. Training History Analysis
Created `analyze_training_history.py` which revealed:
- **Stage 1 Success**: Model achieved 86.2% accuracy on basic SCAN
- **Catastrophic Interference**: 8.2x loss increase when modifications introduced in Stage 2
- **Complete Stagnation**: No improvement in Stages 2-4, model stuck at degraded performance
- **Parallel to Physics**: Mirrors the 235-400% degradation seen in physics TTA experiments

Key insight: Both physics and language experiments show that standard neural architectures fundamentally struggle with distribution invention tasks.

#### 2. Model Architecture Analysis
The original architecture's weaknesses:
- **Weak Modification Signal**: Cross-attention alone is insufficient for rule modification
- **No Selective Mechanism**: Model tries to modify everything instead of targeted changes
- **No Memory Protection**: Base knowledge gets overwritten during modification training

#### 3. Architectural Improvements (models_v2.py)
Implemented improved architecture with:
- **Explicit Gating Mechanism**: `GatedModificationLayer` that computes gates to selectively apply modifications
- **Stronger Signal Propagation**: Modification signal concatenated to all layers, not just cross-attention
- **Progressive Refinement**: Multiple gated layers for incremental modification
- **Residual Connections**: Preserve base knowledge while applying changes

Formula: `output = gate * modification + (1 - gate) * original`

#### 4. Mixed Training Strategy
Created `train_with_mixed_strategy.py` that:
- **Stage 1**: 100% base SCAN examples (no modifications)
- **Stage 2**: 70% base + 30% modifications
- **Stage 3**: 50% base + 50% modifications
- **Stage 4**: 30% base + 70% modifications

This gradual introduction should help maintain base performance while learning modifications.

### Technical Achievements
1. ✅ Created comprehensive diagnostic tools for analyzing model behavior
2. ✅ Implemented improved architecture with explicit gating mechanisms
3. ✅ Developed mixed training strategy to combat catastrophic interference
4. ✅ Established clear metrics for measuring interference (loss spike factor, accuracy degradation)

### Next Steps
1. **Run Full Training**: Execute mixed training strategy with improved architecture on Paperspace
2. **Ablation Studies**:
   - Compare v1 vs v2 architecture on same data
   - Test different mix ratios (90/10, 80/20, etc.)
   - Evaluate gating mechanism effectiveness
3. **Modification Analysis**: Visualize which rules the gates are modifying
4. **Baseline Comparisons**: Run same experiments with MAML, GFlowNet for fair comparison

### Research Implications
Today's work confirms that distribution invention is a fundamental challenge requiring architectural innovations beyond standard deep learning. The parallel between physics and language catastrophic interference suggests this is a domain-agnostic problem that needs new theoretical frameworks.

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Catastrophic Interference Metric**: Loss spike factor between stages

- **Base Retention**: Accuracy on unmodified examples after modification training
- **Gate Analysis**: Average gate activation per modification type
