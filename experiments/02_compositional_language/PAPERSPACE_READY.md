# Compositional Language Training - Ready for Paperspace!

## All Issues Resolved âœ…

We've successfully fixed all runtime errors through comprehensive local testing:

1. **Import Errors** - Fixed incorrect module imports
2. **Method Errors** - Fixed tokenizer method names
3. **Missing Code** - Ensured all methods are committed to production
4. **Dataset Format** - Fixed to return (inputs, targets) for model.fit()
5. **Model Output** - Fixed to return tensor instead of dict during training
6. **Graph Mode** - Fixed conditional logic with tf.cond for TF compilation

## Validation Infrastructure Created

- `test_training_locally.py` - Runs actual training with minimal data
- `validate_production_only.sh` - Ensures code is in production before deployment
- `VALIDATION_LESSONS_FINAL.md` - Documents the journey and key insights

## Key Insight

**"There is no local. There is only production."**

All code has been pushed to production and is ready for GPU training.

## Paperspace Deployment Instructions

1. **On Paperspace, pull latest code:**
   ```bash
   cd /notebooks/neural_networks_research
   git pull origin production
   ```

2. **Navigate to experiment:**
   ```bash
   cd experiments/02_compositional_language
   ```

3. **Run the training script:**
   ```bash
   python paperspace_train_with_safeguards.py
   ```

## What the Script Will Do

1. **Generate all required data** (SCAN dataset processing and modifications)
2. **Train through 4 progressive stages:**
   - Stage 1: Basic compositional rules (5 epochs)
   - Stage 2: Simple modifications (5 epochs)
   - Stage 3: Complex modifications (5 epochs)
   - Stage 4: Novel rule combinations (5 epochs)
3. **Save to persistent storage** at `/storage/compositional_language_[timestamp]/`
4. **Emergency saves** before any potential shutdown
5. **Log to Weights & Biases** for experiment tracking

## Expected Runtime

- Data generation: ~5 minutes
- Training (4 stages): ~2-4 hours on P4000 GPU
- Total: ~3-5 hours

## Success Metrics

- Stage 1 accuracy should reach >90%
- Stage 2-3 should maintain >70% on modified rules
- Stage 4 tests true compositional generalization

## Post-Training

Results will be saved to:
- `/storage/compositional_language_[timestamp]/`
  - `final_model.h5` - Trained model weights
  - `vocabulary.json` - Tokenizer vocabulary
  - `training_history.json` - Loss/accuracy curves
  - `evaluation_results.json` - Test set performance

## Status: READY TO LAUNCH! ðŸš€

All runtime errors have been caught and fixed through local testing.
The script is production-tested and ready for GPU training.
