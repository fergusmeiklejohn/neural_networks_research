# Compositional Language Experiment - Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. Data Infrastructure
- **SCAN Data Loader** (`scan_data_loader.py`)
  - Downloads all SCAN splits automatically
  - Parses 64,196 samples across 6 splits
  - Creates isolated train/val/test sets with no leakage
  - Extrapolation tests: primitive combinations, length, modifiers

### 2. Modification Generator
- **Linguistic Modifications** (`modification_generator.py`)
  - Generates 1,100 systematic rule modifications
  - Types: simple swaps, action modifications, structural changes
  - Examples: "jump" ‚Üí "walk", directions reversed, new action meanings

### 3. Model Architecture
- **Compositional Models** (`models.py`)
  - `CompositionalRuleExtractor`: Transformer-based rule learning
  - `RuleModificationComponent`: Modifies rules based on requests
  - `SequenceGenerator`: Generates action sequences with beam search
  - Combined into `CompositionalLanguageModel` (~50M parameters)

### 4. Training Pipeline
- **Progressive Curriculum** (`train_progressive_curriculum.py`)
  - 4-stage training adapted from physics success
  - Stage 1: Basic SCAN learning
  - Stage 2: Simple modifications (30% mix)
  - Stage 3: Complex modifications (50% mix)
  - Stage 4: Novel generation focus (70% mix)
  - Includes tokenizer, dataset creation, and evaluation

### 5. Testing & Validation
- All components tested and working
- Quick test script validates full pipeline
- Ready for full training run

## üìä Key Statistics

- **Dataset**: 64,196 SCAN samples
- **Vocabulary**: 17 command words, 10 action tokens
- **Modifications**: 1,100 rule modification pairs
- **Model Size**: ~50M parameters (configurable)
- **Training Time**: ~8 hours estimated on A4000

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run full training on Paperspace A4000
2. Monitor via Weights & Biases
3. Evaluate on all test splits

### Analysis
1. Compare results to physics experiment
2. Analyze which modifications work best
3. Test novel combination generation
4. Document insights for next experiments

## üí° Key Insights So Far

1. **Discrete Challenge**: Adapted continuous physics approach to discrete tokens
2. **Exact Match**: Stricter evaluation than physics (no partial credit)
3. **Compositional Structure**: More explicit than physics rules
4. **Modification Space**: Finite but rich enough for testing

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [x] >95% accuracy on standard SCAN ‚ùå (Achieved: 86.2%)
- [ ] >70% consistency on rule modifications ‚ùå (Achieved: 84.4% but with catastrophic interference)
- [ ] >60% validity on novel combinations ‚ùå (Achieved: 82.6% with further degradation)
- [ ] Evidence of true compositional understanding ‚ùå (Shows catastrophic interference instead)

## üìù Training Results (July 22, 2025)

### First Complete 4-Stage Run
- **Stage 1 (Basic SCAN)**: 86.2% accuracy ‚úì - Strong baseline
- **Stage 2 (Simple Mods)**: 84.4% accuracy, 8x loss increase ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Stage 3 (Complex Mods)**: 84.4% accuracy, complete stagnation ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Stage 4 (Novel Gen)**: 82.6% accuracy, further degradation ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Key Finding: Catastrophic Interference
- Parallels physics TTA failure (235-400% degradation)
- 800% loss increase when modifications introduced
- Confirms distribution invention is fundamentally different from standard learning

### Next Architecture Improvements
1. Stronger modification signals (concatenate to all layers)
2. Explicit gating mechanisms
3. Mixed training with unmodified examples
4. Memory components to maintain base knowledge
