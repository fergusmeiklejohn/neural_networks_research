## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Integration Tasks

### High Priority

1. **Introduction** (`introduction_draft.md`)
   - [ ] Change opening to focus on physics mechanism shifts
   - [ ] Acknowledge recent advances (PeTTA, TAIP)
   - [ ] Use claim tempering language

2. **Results Section** (`results_draft.md`)
   - [ ] Insert `pendulum_results_section.md` content
   - [ ] Add statistical significance (p-values, CIs)
   - [ ] Update all tables with error bars

3. **Background Section** (`background_draft.md`)
   - [ ] Insert `recent_advances_section.md` as Section 2.3
   - [ ] Update related work to position relative to new papers

4. **Discussion Section** (`analysis_draft.md`)
   - [ ] Insert `contemporary_tta_discussion.md` as Section 5.4
   - [ ] Temper universal claims throughout

5. **Methods Section** (`methods_draft.md`)
   - [ ] Add pendulum experimental setup
   - [ ] Define "mechanism shift" precisely

### Medium Priority

6. **Conclusion** (`conclusion_draft.md`)
   - [ ] Scope claims to physics mechanism shifts
   - [ ] Acknowledge complementary nature to recent work
   - [ ] Suggest future directions for mechanism learning

7. **Figures**
   - [ ] Create Figure 1: Mechanism vs statistical shift
   - [ ] Add error bars to all plots
   - [ ] Create gradient alignment visualization

## Key Messages to Maintain

1. **Core Finding**: TTA fails on mechanism shifts (not contradicted by recent work)
2. **Positioning**: Complementary to PeTTA/TAIP, identifying boundaries
3. **Contribution**: Diagnostic tools + taxonomy + new challenge area
4. **Tone**: Measured, scientific, properly scoped

## Next Steps

1. Start with Introduction revision (highest impact)
2. Integrate new sections into respective parts
3. Add statistical rigor throughout
4. Create missing figures
5. Final consistency pass

## Response to Reviewer Draft

"We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. In response:

1. **Empirical Breadth**: Added pendulum experiments showing TTA degradation persists across different mechanism types (12-18x even with physics-aware losses).

2. **Recent Literature**: Integrated PeTTA, TAIP, and TTAB throughout, positioning our work as identifying boundaries of current methods rather than contradicting recent advances.

3. **Tempered Claims**: Revised throughout to specify 'physics tasks with mechanism shifts' and 'self-supervised adaptation methods.'

4. **Statistical Rigor**: Added confidence intervals, p-values, and error bars to all results.

5. **Style Improvements**: Removed rhetorical questions, varied number presentation, and improved citation balance.

These revisions strengthen our contribution while properly contextualizing it within the broader OOD generalization landscape."
