## 5.4 Relationship to Contemporary TTA Improvements

Our findings of TTA failure on mechanism shifts might seem to contradict recent successes like PeTTA and TAIP. However, these approaches address different aspects of the adaptation challenge:

### Understanding the Discrepancy

**PeTTA's Collapse Detection**: PeTTA successfully prevents parameter drift and maintains stable predictions by detecting when adaptation leads to degenerate solutions. In our pendulum experiment, PeTTA would correctly identify that converging to constant predictions is problematic. However, detection alone cannot guide adaptation toward learning the new L̇/L term that emerges with time-varying length. The model lacks the computational structure to represent this new physical coupling.

**TAIP's Physics Constraints**: TAIP elegantly uses energy conservation and Hamiltonian structure to constrain adaptation in molecular dynamics. This works brilliantly when the underlying physics principles remain fixed—only atomic positions and velocities change. In our mechanism shifts, however, these constraints become misleading. For the time-varying pendulum, enforcing energy conservation (which no longer holds) would prevent the model from learning the correct dynamics where energy legitimately changes due to work done by length variation.

**TTAB's Taxonomy**: The TTAB benchmark identifies various failure modes of TTA, including temporal correlation shift and label distribution changes. Our mechanism shifts represent an extreme case not fully captured in their taxonomy: the functional form of the data-generating process changes, requiring new computational operations absent from the original model architecture.

### A Refined Understanding

This analysis suggests three distinct adaptation scenarios:

1. **Parameter Adaptation** (TAIP's domain): The computational structure remains valid; only numerical parameters need adjustment. Physics-aware constraints guide successful adaptation.

2. **Stability Preservation** (PeTTA's domain): The model risks collapse due to accumulated errors or confirmation bias. Monitoring and intervention maintain reasonable performance within the model's capabilities.

3. **Mechanism Learning** (Our focus): New computational operations are required. No amount of parameter adjustment or stability preservation can introduce the missing L̇/L term or time-dependent gravity modulation.

### Implications for Future Work

Current TTA improvements operate within the learned computational framework. When mechanism shifts require expanding this framework, we need fundamentally different approaches:

- **Modular architectures** that can activate dormant computational pathways
- **Program synthesis** methods that can introduce new operations at test time
- **Hybrid systems** combining parametric adaptation with structural learning

Our work thus complements recent advances by delineating where current methods succeed and identifying mechanism learning as a critical open challenge. The success of PeTTA and TAIP within their domains makes the mechanism shift challenge even more stark: these are not methods failing due to simple implementation issues, but rather fundamental limitations when the problem structure changes.
