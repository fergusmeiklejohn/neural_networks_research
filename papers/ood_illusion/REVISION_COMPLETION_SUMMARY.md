## Key Paper Updates

### Abstract
- Includes pendulum results (12-18x degradation)
- Mentions PeTTA implementation
- Tempered claims appropriately

### Introduction
- Positions work relative to PeTTA, TAIP, TTAB
- Uses measured language
- Clearly scopes claims to mechanism shifts

### Results Section
- Now includes proper statistics (mean ± 95% CI)
- All degradations have p-values
- Tables show:
  - Two-ball: 238% TTA degradation
  - Pendulum: 12-18x physics-aware TTA degradation
  - PeTTA: 0.16% improvement (not significant)

### Discussion
- Added "Relationship to Contemporary TTA" section
- Explains why physics-aware losses fail
- Acknowledges what we didn't test

### Conclusion
- Appropriately scoped claims
- Emphasizes complementary nature to recent advances
- Points to future research directions
