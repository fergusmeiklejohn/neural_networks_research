# Response Plan to Review 1

## Overview
This document outlines our strategy to address the reviewer's constructive feedback on "The OOD Illusion in Physics Learning." The reviewer's main concerns center on: (1) empirical breadth, (2) overly broad claims, (3) missing recent literature, and (4) stylistic polish.

## High-Priority Content Revisions

### 1. Broaden Empirical Base (Critical)
**Issue**: All evidence comes from one synthetic scenario (2-ball dynamics with sinusoidal gravity).

**Action Plan**:
- Add **variable pendulum length** experiment:
  - Training: Fixed length pendulum
  - Test: Time-varying length L(t) = L₀(1 + 0.2sin(0.1t))
  - This tests mechanism shift in a different physical system
- Add **damped oscillator** experiment:
  - Training: Constant damping coefficient
  - Test: Time-varying damping γ(t) = γ₀(1 + 0.5sin(0.05t))
  - Different mechanism type (dissipative vs conservative)
- Consider **piecewise gravity** as simpler mechanism shift:
  - Training: g = 9.8 m/s²
  - Test: g switches between 9.8 and 7.8 every 50 timesteps
  - Tests discrete vs continuous mechanism changes

**Implementation Priority**: Start with pendulum (conceptually cleanest), then damped oscillator if time permits.

### 2. Test Physics-Aware TTA Variants
**Issue**: We only tested simple prediction consistency loss. Recent work (TAIP) uses energy/Hamiltonian consistency.

**Action Plan**:
- Implement **energy consistency loss** for TTA:
  ```python
  def energy_consistency_loss(predictions, physics_params):
      # Compute total energy at each timestep
      KE = 0.5 * m * v²
      PE = m * g * h
      E_total = KE + PE
      # Minimize energy variation
      return torch.var(E_total)
  ```
- Test **Hamiltonian consistency** for conservative systems
- Compare with our prediction consistency baseline
- This addresses whether failure is due to loss choice vs adaptation principle

### 3. Temper Universal Claims
**Issue**: Abstract/Introduction claims sound too universal.

**Specific Edits**:
- Abstract: Change "achieving genuine OOD generalization may require fundamentally different approaches" to "achieving OOD generalization on physics tasks with mechanism shifts may require approaches beyond current self-supervised adaptation"
- Introduction: Add qualifier "In the context of physics prediction with changing generative processes..."
- Conclusion: Specify "Our results apply to self-supervised adaptation methods on mechanism-shift tasks"

### 4. Integrate Recent Literature
**Issue**: Missing 2023-2025 works that critique/extend TTA.

**Papers to Add**:
1. **PeTTA (NeurIPS 2024)**: Shows Level-2 AND Level-3 improvements with collapse detection
   - Discuss how collapse detection might help but doesn't address root cause
2. **TAIP (Nature Communications 2025)**: Physics-aware TTA with energy consistency
   - Acknowledge success on inter-atomic potentials
   - Explain why mechanism shifts differ from parameter shifts
3. **TTAB Benchmark (ICML 2023)**: Comprehensive TTA evaluation
   - Position our work as identifying specific failure mode

**Integration Strategy**:
- Add new subsection in Background: "Recent Advances in Stabilized TTA"
- In Discussion: "Relationship to Contemporary Approaches"
- Acknowledge these works strengthen TTA but don't solve mechanism shifts

## Medium-Priority Revisions

### 5. Add Statistical Rigor
- Calculate 95% confidence intervals for all performance metrics
- Replace "no method improves" with "no tested method showed statistically significant improvement (p > 0.05)"
- Add error bars to all tables/figures

### 6. Style Improvements
- Remove rhetorical question in Introduction
- Vary presentation of headline numbers (235%, 62,290%)
- Move speculative statements to explicit "Future Work" subsection
- Fix cross-references to figures/tables

### 7. Create Proper Figures
- Figure 1: Schematic of mechanism shift vs statistical shift
- Figure 2: Time-varying gravity trajectory examples
- Figure 3: Performance degradation with error bars
- Figure 4: Gradient alignment visualization
- Figure 5: Representation space analysis (UMAP)

### 8. Complete Bibliography
- Compile 40-50 references with proper formatting
- Include DOIs and arXiv IDs
- Ensure all citations are bidirectional

## Response Strategy

### Narrative Framing
Position our work as:
1. **Complementary** to recent advances (not contradictory)
2. **Identifying a specific failure mode** that persists despite stabilization
3. **Proposing diagnostic tools** (gradient alignment, representation analysis)
4. **Opening discussion** about mechanism shifts as distinct challenge

### Key Message Refinement
From: "All OOD methods fail on true extrapolation"
To: "Self-supervised adaptation methods show systematic failure on physics tasks with mechanism shifts, suggesting this class of distribution shift requires different approaches than current methods provide"
