## 1  Content — scientific soundness & positioning

**Aspect**	**Strengths**	**Limitations / points to tighten**
**Experimental clarity**	• Task, simulator and train/test splits are spelled-out in §3 *Methods* .  • Hyper-parameters, architecture and evaluation metrics are explicit, making replication feasible.	• All evidence comes from *one* synthetic scenario (two-ball dynamics with sinusoidal *g(t)*).  It is hard to generalise sweeping conclusions from a single mechanism-shift task.  Repeating the study on, e.g., pendulum length-varying systems, damped oscillators or a “constant-to-piecewise” gravity schedule would strengthen the claim that failures are systemic rather than task-specific.
**Findings on adaptation collapse**	• Clear quantitative evidence: -235 % error for TTA and +62 290 % for MAML after adaptation .  • Gradient-alignment diagnosis (mean cosine –0.73) elegantly explains the degeneracy .	• The self-supervised loss you chose (“prediction consistency”) is one of the simplest.  Recent physics-aware TTA variants use energy or Hamiltonian consistency and report success (e.g. TAIP for inter-atomic potentials) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57101-4  .  A short ablation with such alternatives would forestall the objection that the failure stems from the loss, not from adaptation in principle.
**Comparison with contemporary work**	• Your taxonomy (surface → statistical → mechanism shift) is novel and empirically motivated .  It dovetails with concerns raised in the mechanics OOD benchmark of Yuan et al. (2022) https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14917  , but provides clearer diagnostic tools (representation-hull distance, gradient alignment).	• The draft asserts that “current OOD methods succeed on Level 1–2 and fail on Level 3” as a blanket statement.  Yet the 2025 PeTTA work shows Level-2 *and* Level-3 improvements once collapse detection is added  https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/df29d63af05cb91d705cf06ba5945b9d-Paper-Conference.pdf.  The discussion should acknowledge these stabilisation strategies and explain why they might still fall short under mechanism change.
**Scope of claims**	• The paper is careful to state limitations in §8 Conclusion .	• In the Abstract and Introduction, however, wording such as “suggest that achieving genuine OOD generalisation may require fundamentally different approaches than those currently popular” sounds universal.  Calibrate the claim to “physics-mechanism shifts” or “tasks where the generative process changes.”
**Trustworthiness**	For the studied setting the evidence is convincing; results are large-margin, backed by gradient diagnostics, robustness checks and multiple seeds.  I would *trust the specific finding* that naïve self-supervised adaptation can collapse under mechanism shift.  I would *remain agnostic* on the broader claim that *all* current OOD methods fail until the study is replicated on more tasks and with newer stabilised TTA variants.

## 2  Style — structure, tone and scholarly polish

**Dimension**	**What works**	**Recommended edits**
**Overall structure**	The outline in *full_paper_draft.md* is standard (Intro → Background → Methods → Results → Analysis → Taxonomy → Implications → Conclusion) and matches ML venues.	Merge the individual Markdown fragments into a single compiled document before submission; cross-references (“Figure 1 (not shown)”) should point to actual numbered figures.
**Abstract & Intro**	Engaging, clear problem statement.	They repeat the headline numbers twice (–235 %, +62 290 %).  Re-phrase one instance.  Avoid rhetorical questions (“Consider two scenarios…”) – replace with declarative statements.
**Argumentation style**	Sections 4 and 5 flow logically from empirical results to mechanistic insight.	Avoid absolute language (“no method improves”) unless statistically proven.  Use 95 % CIs to support such statements.
**Citation practice**	Draft cites key TTA papers (TENT, MEMO) in Background .	Add 2023-2025 works that critique or extend TTA: *TTAB benchmark* https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23d/zhao23d.pdf , *Persistent TTA* https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/df29d63af05cb91d705cf06ba5945b9d-Paper-Conference.pdf , and physics-positive TTA (TAIP) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57101-4  to give a balanced view.
**Tables & figures**	Numerical tables are clear and have caption context.	Every figure/table should be referenced in text (“Table 2 shows …”) and include std. errors.  Consider adding an error-bar plot to replace the ASCII summary in §4.6.
**Tone & voice**	Mostly formal, fits typical ML/physics venues.	Replace first-person plural verbs that signal speculation (“we speculate”) with evidence-backed phrasing or move them to a clearly labelled *Future Work* subsection.
**Reference list promise**	“40-50 references” placeholder reminds the reader.	Compile a full bibliography in the chosen style (ICML/NeurIPS or journal), including arXiv IDs or DOIs.  Make sure every in-text citation appears in the list and vice-versa.

### High-impact revisions to prioritise
1. Broaden empirical base: Add at least one more mechanism-shift task (e.g., variable spring constant or damped pendulum) and a physics-aware TTA baseline to demonstrate that the phenomenon is not simulator-specific.
2. Temper universal claims: Re-write Abstract/Conclusion sentences to specify that results are for self-supervised adaptation on mechanism-shift physics tasks.
3. Integrate recent literature: Discuss PeTTA (NeurIPS 2024) and TAIP (Nat Comm 2025) to position your findings as a complementary cautionary tale rather than a contradiction.
4. Finalize references & figures: Build the full bibliography; insert all referenced figures/tables with numbering and captions.

⠀
Addressing these will make the paper scientifically stronger and stylistically ready for submission to a top ML or computational-physics venue.
