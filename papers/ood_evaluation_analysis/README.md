# OOD Evaluation Analysis Paper

## Overview

This paper presents a scholarly analysis of out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation methods in physics-informed neural networks. We examine the distinction between interpolation and extrapolation through systematic experiments on 2D ball dynamics.

## Status

**Current Stage**: Initial drafting
**Target**: Technical report / conference submission

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

1. **Representation Space Analysis**: 91.7% of "far-OOD" samples in standard benchmarks appear to be interpolation rather than extrapolation when analyzed in representation space.

2. **Performance Gap**: Models show 3,000-55,000x performance degradation between reported results and controlled experiments, suggesting different evaluation conditions.

3. **True OOD Challenge**: Time-varying physical parameters create genuinely out-of-distribution scenarios that all current methods fail to handle.
