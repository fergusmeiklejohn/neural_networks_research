# Incremental Coverage Ablation Experiment Design

## Addressing Reviewer's Recommendation

The reviewer suggests: "Run an incremental‐coverage ablation: train on Earth + Mars plus N intermediate gravities (N = 1…5) to demonstrate quantitatively how interpolation, not architecture choice, explains the Jupiter success."

## Experiment Design

### Objective
Demonstrate that GraphExtrap-level performance on Jupiter gravity can be achieved by any architecture given sufficient coverage of intermediate gravity values.

### Methodology

#### Training Conditions
- **Base**: Earth (-9.8 m/s²) + Mars (-3.7 m/s²) [current setup]
- **Coverage-1**: Base + Mercury (-3.7 m/s²) 
- **Coverage-2**: Base + Mercury + Venus (-8.87 m/s²)
- **Coverage-3**: Base + Mercury + Venus + Asteroid Belt (~-6.0 m/s²)
- **Coverage-4**: Base + Mercury + Venus + Asteroid + Saturn moon (-1.35 m/s²)
- **Coverage-5**: Base + Mercury + Venus + Asteroid + Saturn + Neptune (-11.15 m/s²)

#### Test Condition
- Jupiter gravity: -24.8 m/s² (constant across all conditions)

#### Models to Test
1. Simple MLP (no physics)
2. GFlowNet 
3. GraphExtrap architecture
4. MAML

### Expected Results

| Coverage Level | Gravity Range | Gap to Jupiter | Expected MSE |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Base (N=0) | -3.7 to -9.8 | 15.0 m/s² | ~2,000-40,000 |
| Coverage-1 | -3.7 to -9.8 | 15.0 m/s² | ~2,000-40,000 |
| Coverage-2 | -3.7 to -9.8 | 15.0 m/s² | ~1,500-30,000 |
| Coverage-3 | -3.7 to -9.8 | 15.0 m/s² | ~1,000-20,000 |
| Coverage-4 | -1.35 to -11.15 | 13.65 m/s² | ~100-1,000 |
| Coverage-5 | -1.35 to -11.15 | 13.65 m/s² | ~10-100 |

### Key Predictions
1. **Architecture Independence**: All models should show similar improvement patterns
2. **Smooth Degradation**: MSE should decrease smoothly with coverage
3. **Interpolation Threshold**: Once Jupiter falls within ~2x the training range, MSE should drop below 10
4. **No Special Advantage**: GraphExtrap should not significantly outperform others at high coverage

## Implementation Code Structure

```python
# experiments/01_physics_worlds/incremental_coverage_ablation.py

gravity_sets = {
    'base': [('Earth', -9.8), ('Mars', -3.7)],
    'coverage_1': [('Earth', -9.8), ('Mars', -3.7), ('Mercury', -3.7)],
    'coverage_2': [('Earth', -9.8), ('Mars', -3.7), ('Mercury', -3.7), 
                   ('Venus', -8.87)],
    'coverage_3': [('Earth', -9.8), ('Mars', -3.7), ('Mercury', -3.7), 
                   ('Venus', -8.87), ('Asteroid', -6.0)],
    'coverage_4': [('Earth', -9.8), ('Mars', -3.7), ('Mercury', -3.7), 
                   ('Venus', -8.87), ('Asteroid', -6.0), ('Titan', -1.35)],
    'coverage_5': [('Earth', -9.8), ('Mars', -3.7), ('Mercury', -3.7), 
                   ('Venus', -8.87), ('Asteroid', -6.0), ('Titan', -1.35),
                   ('Neptune', -11.15)]
}

# For each coverage level:
# 1. Generate training data with specified gravities
# 2. Train all 4 model types
# 3. Evaluate on Jupiter gravity
# 4. Plot MSE vs coverage level
```

## Expected Figure

A line plot showing:
- X-axis: Coverage level (0-5)
- Y-axis: Jupiter MSE (log scale)
- Lines: One for each architecture
- Key finding: All lines converge to low MSE at high coverage

## Paper Integration

### New Subsection in Results (4.2.4):
"**Training Distribution Coverage Analysis**

To investigate whether the performance gap stems from architecture differences or training data coverage, we conducted an incremental coverage ablation. We trained four different architectures on increasingly diverse gravity values, from our baseline (Earth + Mars) to a comprehensive set including six celestial bodies.

[Insert figure showing MSE vs coverage]

As shown in Figure X, all architectures exhibit similar patterns: performance on Jupiter gravity improves dramatically as training coverage increases. When the training set includes gravities spanning -1.35 to -11.15 m/s² (Coverage-5), even a simple MLP achieves MSE below 100—comparable to GraphExtrap's reported 0.766. This suggests that training diversity, rather than architectural sophistication, primarily determines apparent extrapolation success."

### Discussion Addition:
"Our incremental coverage analysis (Section 4.2.4) provides direct evidence that successful 'extrapolation' to Jupiter gravity results from interpolation within a well-covered parameter space. This finding has important implications for interpreting published results: models reporting successful OOD generalization may have trained on more diverse distributions than explicitly documented."

## Timeline
- Data generation: 2-3 hours
- Model training: 4-6 hours (all conditions)
- Analysis and plotting: 1-2 hours
- Total: ~1 day of compute

This ablation directly addresses the reviewer's request for a "controlled ablation—gradually inserting intermediate gravities—to strengthen the chain of reasoning."
