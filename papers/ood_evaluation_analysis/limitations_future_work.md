# 6. Limitations and Future Work

## 6.1 Limitations

### 6.1.1 Scope of Experiments

Our analysis focuses on a specific physics learning task—2D ball dynamics with gravitational variation. While this provides a controlled setting for studying interpolation versus extrapolation, several limitations should be acknowledged:

- **Limited Physics Complexity**: Real-world physics involves more complex interactions including friction, air resistance, deformation, and multi-body effects. The generalizability of our findings to these scenarios requires further investigation.

- **Single Domain**: We examine only classical mechanics. Other physics domains (fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics) may exhibit different interpolation-extrapolation characteristics.

- **Dimensionality**: Our 2D environment may not capture the challenges of high-dimensional physics problems where the interpolation-extrapolation boundary becomes less clear.

### 6.1.2 Experimental Constraints

Several experimental limitations affect the interpretation of our results:

- **Limited Seeds**: Due to computational constraints, some baseline results represent single training runs rather than multiple seeds with statistical analysis. This particularly affects our confidence intervals for performance comparisons.

- **Training Data Access**: We could not access the exact training data used in published GraphExtrap results, requiring us to infer training conditions from performance patterns.

- **Architecture Variations**: Our baseline implementations may differ from original versions in undocumented ways that affect performance.

### 6.1.3 Methodological Considerations

- **Representation Space Analysis**: Our convex hull approach, while intuitive, represents one of many possible ways to distinguish interpolation from extrapolation. Alternative geometric or topological characterizations might yield different conclusions.

- **Density Estimation**: The kernel density estimation used for representation analysis involves hyperparameter choices (bandwidth selection) that influence results.

- **Binary Classification**: Our categorization of samples as requiring "interpolation" or "extrapolation" simplifies what may be a continuous spectrum.

## 6.2 Future Work

### 6.2.1 Immediate Extensions

Several natural extensions of this work would strengthen and broaden our findings:

**Comprehensive Baseline Study**:
- Test with multiple random seeds and report confidence intervals
- Implement exact architectures from published papers
- Systematically vary training distribution coverage

**Extended Physics Domains**:
- 3D rigid body dynamics
- Soft body physics with deformation
- Fluid dynamics with varying viscosity
- Electromagnetic simulations with changing material properties

**Alternative OOD Characterizations**:
- Topological data analysis of representation spaces
- Information-theoretic measures of distribution shift
- Causal graph divergence metrics

### 6.2.2 Methodological Advances

**Principled OOD Benchmark Design**:
Future work should establish standardized protocols for creating and validating OOD benchmarks:
- Formal criteria for "impossible interpolation" scenarios
- Automated verification of representation space separation
- Benchmark suites spanning multiple physics domains

**Theoretical Framework**:
Developing theoretical understanding of when and why neural networks can extrapolate:
- Connections between architecture design and extrapolation capability
- Sample complexity bounds for learning modifiable physics
- Characterization of learnable vs. unlearnable distribution shifts

### 6.2.3 Architectural Innovations

**Adaptive Physics Models**:
Our results motivate research into architectures that can:
- Learn modular, composable physics components
- Detect when physics assumptions are violated
- Adapt representations based on observed violations

**Hybrid Approaches**:
Following successful examples from ARC-AGI:
- Combine symbolic physics engines with neural components
- Use program synthesis to extract modifiable rules
- Implement meta-learning over physics structures, not just parameters

### 6.2.4 Practical Applications

**Deployment Guidance**:
- Develop tools for practitioners to assess whether their use case requires true extrapolation
- Create diagnostic tests to run before deployment
- Build confidence estimation methods that account for representation-space distance

**Benchmark Reform**:
- Audit existing physics ML benchmarks for interpolation vs. extrapolation
- Propose updated versions that test genuine extrapolation
- Establish community standards for OOD evaluation

### 6.2.5 Broader Research Questions

Our work raises several fundamental questions for future investigation:

1. **Is true neural extrapolation possible?** Or do all successful cases reduce to sophisticated interpolation given sufficient training coverage?

2. **What is the relationship between model scale and extrapolation?** Do larger models simply achieve better coverage, or do they develop qualitatively different capabilities?

3. **How can we formalize the notion of "structural" vs. "parametric" distribution shift?** Current definitions remain intuitive rather than mathematical.

4. **What role does physics knowledge play?** Our results suggest rigid constraints hurt, but perhaps more flexible incorporation methods could help.

## 6.3 Long-term Vision

The ultimate goal extends beyond identifying problems with current evaluation—we envision systems that can genuinely discover and adapt to new physics. This requires:

- Moving from pattern matching to causal understanding
- Learning laws, not just functions
- Developing representations that support modification and composition

Our analysis represents a necessary step: acknowledging that current methods primarily interpolate. Only by clearly understanding present limitations can we develop approaches that truly extrapolate, enabling AI systems to assist in scientific discovery rather than merely fitting known phenomena.
