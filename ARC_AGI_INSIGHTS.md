# ARC-AGI Insights for Distribution Invention Research

## Key Validation Points

### 1. **Neural Networks CAN Achieve >55% on Novel Tasks**
- This directly addresses reviewer's concern about our claim "no NN extrapolates"
- MindsAI achieved 55.5% using hybrid approaches
- BUT: Still far from human performance (98%)
- Validates our positioning of "controllable extrapolation" as an advancement

### 2. **Hybrid Approaches Essential**
- Pure program synthesis: ~40% max
- Pure transduction (neural): ~40% max
- Combined approaches: 55.5%
- **Lesson**: Our hybrid neural-symbolic approach is on the right track

### 3. **Test-Time Adaptation Critical**
- ARC-AGI requires "knowledge recombination at test time"
- Not just pattern matching from training
- Aligns with our distribution invention requiring runtime rule modification

## Design Principles for Our Experiments

### 1. **Every Task Must Have Different Logic**
- ARC-AGI's key insight: prevent pattern matching by ensuring task diversity
- For us: Each physics modification should require different reasoning
- Not just parameter changes, but structural rule changes

### 2. **Core Knowledge Assumption**
- ARC-AGI assumes only pre-age-4 concepts
- For physics: Basic concepts like gravity, motion, collision
- For language: Basic compositional rules
- Keeps evaluation fair and focused on reasoning

### 3. **Demonstration + Test Format**
```python
# ARC-AGI format adapted for physics
physics_task = {
    "demonstrations": [
        {"input": normal_physics, "output": trajectory},
        {"input": modified_physics, "output": modified_trajectory}
    ],
    "test": {
        "input": novel_physics_modification,
        "expected": inferred_trajectory
    }
}
```

## Evaluation Framework Updates

### 1. **Two-Attempt Policy**
- ARC-AGI allows 2 attempts per test
- Could adopt for our modification tasks
- Allows for initial hypothesis + refinement

### 2. **Prevent Overfitting**
- Private eval set for true performance
- >10% difference between public/private indicates overfitting
- We need similar train/public/private splits

### 3. **Human Baseline Essential**
- ARC-AGI: 98% human performance
- We should establish human baselines for:
  - Physics modifications understanding
  - Language rule modifications
  - Visual concept blending

## Integration with Our Experiments

### Physics Worlds (Experiment 01)
```python
# ARC-style physics tasks
class ARCPhysicsTask:
    def generate_task(self):
        # Show 2-3 examples of physics modification
        demos = [
            ("normal", normal_trajectory),
            ("low_gravity", low_gravity_trajectory),
            ("high_friction", high_friction_trajectory)
        ]

        # Test: Infer behavior with combined modifications
        test = "low_gravity + high_friction"

        # Model must recombine learned modifications
        return demos, test
```

### Abstract Reasoning (Experiment 04)
- Directly integrate subset of ARC-AGI tasks
- Focus on transformation/pattern modification tasks
- Test if distribution invention helps solve ARC tasks

## Critical Insights for Distribution Invention

### 1. **Memorization vs Recombination**
- Deep learning alone scores <1% on original ARC
- Even GPT-3: 0% via direct prompting
- Success requires recombining knowledge in novel ways
- **Our approach**: Learn modifiable rules, not fixed patterns

### 2. **Program Search vs Neural Learning**
- 49% of tasks solvable by brute-force program search
- Suggests some tasks too simple/systematic
- **Our approach**: Ensure modifications require creative recombination

### 3. **The 55% Ceiling**
- Best hybrid approaches plateau around 55%
- Suggests fundamental limitation in current methods
- **Our hypothesis**: Distribution invention could break this ceiling

## Recommendations for Our Research

### 1. **Task Design**
- Each modification should require different reasoning
- Avoid modifications solvable by simple parameter search
- Include tasks requiring creative rule combination

### 2. **Evaluation Rigor**
- Create private test sets never seen during development
- Test human baseline on our modification tasks
- Allow multiple attempts with different strategies

### 3. **Benchmark Integration**
- Include ARC-subset in our abstract reasoning experiment
- Test if distribution invention improves ARC performance
- Could be a differentiator if we exceed 55%

## The Distribution Invention Advantage

ARC-AGI shows current AI struggles with:
1. Tasks requiring novel logic
2. Knowledge recombination at test time
3. Going beyond pattern matching

Our distribution invention directly addresses these by:
1. Learning modifiable rules rather than fixed patterns
2. Explicit rule recombination mechanisms
3. Generating novel distributions at test time

This positions our research as potentially breakthrough work for the exact challenges ARC-AGI highlights.
