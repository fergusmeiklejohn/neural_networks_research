## Resource Summary

### GPU Hours by Phase
- Phase 1 (Months 1-8): 510 hours base + 160 buffer = **670 hours**
- Phase 2 (Months 9-16): 900 hours base + 300 buffer = **1,200 hours**
- Phase 3 (Months 17-24): 850 hours base + 380 buffer = **1,230 hours**
- **Total**: 2,260 hours base + 840 buffer = **3,100 hours**

### Cost Estimates
- A4000 ($0.76/hr): $2,356
- A5000 ($0.84/hr): $2,604
- **Recommended budget**: $3,000 (includes safety margin)

### Key Milestones & Decision Points

**Month 8**: First paper submission
- Decision: Continue with current approach or pivot?

**Month 16**: Journal paper with 4 experiments
- Decision: Focus on specific domain or continue broad approach?

**Month 20**: Near-complete results
- Decision: Additional experiments or focus on thesis?

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Each experiment has independent value
   - Baselines ensure comparative results even if our approach struggles
   - Progressive difficulty allows early validation

2. **Timeline Risks**:
   - 20-30% buffers built into each phase
   - Paper deadlines have backup conferences
   - GPU hours can be adjusted based on early results

3. **Resource Risks**:
   - Start with cheaper experiments (physics/language)
   - Can reduce scope of later experiments if needed
   - Cloud credits and academic discounts available
