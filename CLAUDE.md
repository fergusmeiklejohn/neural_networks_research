# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a neural networks research project focused on developing models that can
**invent new distributions** rather than merely interpolate within their
training distribution. The goal is to create neural networks that can build
"pocket realities" with modified rules to explore novel ideas - mimicking human
creativity and extrapolation capabilities.

### Research Objectives

- **Distribution Construction**: Build models that create coherent new
  probability distributions with selectively modified constraints
- **Controlled Extrapolation**: Enable principled exploration of the "adjacent
  possible" - ideas just outside training boundaries
- **Rule Modification**: Develop architectures that can identify, modify, and
  consistently apply rule changes
- **Insight Transfer**: Create mechanisms for mapping insights from invented
  distributions back to base distributions

## Development Environment

### Python Environment Setup

The project uses a Conda environment named `dist-invention` with Python 3.11:

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate dist-invention

# Key dependencies
pip install keras>=3.0 torch jax[metal] transformers wandb
```

### Backend Configuration

The project uses **Keras 3** with multi-backend support:

- **Primary Backend**: JAX with Metal acceleration (Mac)
- **Alternative Backends**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Configure via `~/.keras/keras.json` or `KERAS_BACKEND` environment variable

### Development Tools

- **IDE**: VS Code with Python Interactive files (`.py` with `# %%` cells)
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter for final presentations/sharing
- **Experiment Tracking**: Weights & Biases (`wandb`)
- **Code Quality**: black, flake8, isort, pytest

## Project Structure

### Current State

The project is in the **planning phase** with comprehensive documentation but no
implementation yet.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. DistributionInventor Model

```python
class DistributionInventor(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        self.rule_extractor = CausalRuleExtractor()
        self.modifier = SelectiveRuleModifier()
        self.generator = DistributionGenerator()
        self.consistency_checker = ConsistencyNetwork()
        self.insight_mapper = InsightExtractor()
```

### 2. Key Components

- **Causal Disentanglement Module**: Separates causal mechanisms from parameters
- **Distribution Generator Network**: Creates new coherent distributions from
  base + modification requests
- **Consistency Enforcer**: Ensures non-modified rules remain intact using
  energy-based formulation
- **Insight Extractor**: Maps patterns from generated distributions back to base
  distribution

## Development Commands

### Setup Commands

```bash
# Initial setup (run once)
source scripts/setup_env.sh              # Load environment variables
pip install -e .                         # Install project in development mode

# Development environment verification
python test_setup.py                     # Test installation
python -c "import keras; print(keras.backend.backend())"  # Check backend
```

### Running Experiments

```bash
# Training commands (to be implemented)
python scripts/train.py --experiment physics_worlds
python scripts/train.py --experiment compositional_language

# Evaluation commands (to be implemented)
python scripts/evaluate_distribution.py --model_path outputs/checkpoints/model.keras
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Formatting and linting
black .                                   # Format code
isort .                                   # Sort imports

pytest tests/test_distribution_generator.py  # Run specific test
```

### Jupyter/Interactive Development

```bash
# Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab                              # Full Jupyter environment

# VS Code Interactive Python
# Open .py files with # %% cells and run with Shift+Enter
```

## Experiment Workflow

### 3-Phase Training Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Learn Base Distributions**
   - Train on standard datasets to learn rule extraction
   - Use reconstruction tasks to ensure rule completeness

2. **Phase 2: Controlled Modification**
   - Synthetic tasks with known rule modifications
   - Train to maintain consistency while changing specific rules

3. **Phase 3: Creative Generation**
   - Open-ended modification requests
   - Reward novel-but-coherent outputs
   - Use human feedback for quality assessment

### Experiment Progression

1. **Physics Worlds**: 2D ball dynamics with gravity/friction modifications
2. **Compositional Language**: SCAN dataset with rule modifications
3. **Visual Concepts**: ImageNet with object attribute blending
4. **Abstract Reasoning**: ARC-like puzzles requiring novel rule combinations
5. **Mathematical Extension**: Non-commutative multiplication, 4D geometry
6. **Multi-Modal Transfer**: Cross-modal rule application

## Success Metrics

- **Novel Coherence**: Models generate novel but coherent outputs when modifying
  specific constraints
- **Graceful Degradation**: Performance degrades gracefully (not
  catastrophically) outside training distribution
- **Internal Consistency**: Generated distributions maintain consistency while
  violating specified rules
- **Human Evaluation**: Outputs are rated as "surprisingly sensible" and useful

## Compute Requirements

### Development Phases

- **Local (Mac)**: Initial prototyping, small-scale tests
- **Colab**: Quick experiments, proof of concepts
- **Paperspace**: Main development and training
  - Phase 1: P4000 ($0.51/hr) for models <100M parameters
  - Phase 2: A4000 ($0.76/hr) for models up to 1B parameters

  technical approach
- `setup_distribution_invention.md`: Detailed development environment setup
- `configs/experiment_configs.yaml`: Hyperparameter configurations (to be
  created)
- `models/core/distribution_generator.py`: Core model implementation (to be

## Environment Variables

Set these in `.env` file:

```bash
KERAS_BACKEND=jax                        # Primary backend
WANDB_PROJECT=distribution-invention     # Experiment tracking
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.8      # JAX memory settings
DATA_DIR=./data                          # Data directory
OUTPUT_DIR=./outputs                     # Output directory
```

## Next Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Development Environment**: Execute setup guide to create directory
   structure
2. **Implement Core Architecture**: Create `DistributionInventor` base classes
3. **Physics Experiment**: Start with simplest experiment (2D physics worlds)
4. **Evaluation Framework**: Build consistent evaluation metrics across
   experiments
5. **Scale Gradually**: Move from local prototyping to cloud training

## Notes

- **Current State**: Planning phase complete, ready for implementation
- **Multi-Backend**: Keras 3 provides flexibility across JAX/PyTorch/TensorFlow
- **Interactive Development**: Use VS Code with Python Interactive files for
  rapid prototyping
- **Experiment Tracking**: All experiments should log to Weights & Biases
- **Timeline**: 4-month research plan with systematic experiment progression

## Notes for execution

We always keep an EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md file in each Experiment folder. We keep it
up to date with the current state of the experiment. And use it to guide the
execution of the experiment.

### Planning Documentation

When planning next steps for experiments, we create timestamped plan documents in
a `claude-plans` folder within each experiment directory. These plans should:
- Include the date and time in the filename (e.g., `2025-06-27_physics_worlds_next_steps.md`)
- Provide context about the current state
- List specific, actionable steps in priority order
- Include success metrics and risk mitigation strategies
- Emphasize scientific validity and proper data isolation
