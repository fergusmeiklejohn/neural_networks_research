Review of “Distribution Invention in Neural Networks”

1. Overall appraisal

The proposal is ambitious and timely, tackling the long-standing problem that most neural networks interpolate rather than extrapolate. Its framing of distribution invention is novel and aligns with current work on causal and counterfactual generation. Strong points include a clear modular architecture diagram, a phased curriculum, and plans to open-source benchmarks. Areas that need strengthening are (i) grounding in the very latest empirical findings, (ii) the realism of the 24-month timeline, and (iii) richer, sharper evaluation and risk-mitigation strategies.

2. Detailed critique & actionable suggestions

Background & motivation
	•	Strengths: vivid examples; persuasive link to AGI.
	•	Gaps/risks: the claim that no NN extrapolates overlooks recent out-of-distribution (OOD) and compositional breakthroughs.
	•	Suggestions: temper the claim; cite models that reach >55 % on ARC-AGI with neurosymbolic search; position the new work as bringing controllable extrapolation.

Research questions & hypotheses
	•	Strengths: clear decomposition into rule extraction → transformation → coherence checks.
	•	Gaps/risks: H2 assumes curriculum learning alone will work—evidence is mixed.
	•	Suggestions: add a fallback plan (e.g. hybrid symbolic planners or latent-program search) if curriculum proves insufficient.

Literature review
	•	Strengths: covers causal representation learning and PINNs.
	•	Gaps/risks: misses 2024-25 advances on GFlowNets, diffusion-based counterfactuals and scale-driven compositionality.
	•	Suggestions: integrate the references listed in § 3.

Methodology
	•	Strengths: modular design across multiple domains.
	•	Gaps/risks:
	1.	CausalRuleExtractor is under-specified.
	2.	24 months seems optimistic given engineering and compute demands (> 2 M GPU-hours likely).
	3.	No explicit baselines.
	•	Suggestions:
	•	Specify extraction method (e.g. CGNNs or Independence-guided encoders).
	•	Either extend year-1 to 18 months or start with two domains; justify compute budget.
	•	Add baselines such as ERM + data augmentation, GFlowNet-guided search and graph extrapolation models.

Evaluation
	•	Strengths: mixes quantitative and qualitative assessment.
	•	Gaps/risks: current metrics are too coarse (e.g. “> 75 % coherence”).
	•	Suggestions: separate in-distribution consistency from intervention consistency; include ARC-AGI, gSCAN, COGS and WOODS for benchmarking.

Broader impacts & ethics
	•	Strengths: recognises the need for transparency and controllability.
	•	Gaps/risks: no discussion of dual-use or hallucinated unsafe distributions.
	•	Suggestions: add a safety work-package: automatic detectors for implausible/unsafe invented distributions and red-teaming protocols.
