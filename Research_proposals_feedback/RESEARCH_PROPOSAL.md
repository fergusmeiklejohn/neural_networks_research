# Research Proposal: Distribution Invention in Neural Networks

## Teaching Neural Networks to Think Outside Their Training Distribution

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a novel research program to develop neural networks
capable of **distribution invention** - the ability to generate coherent new
probability distributions by selectively modifying learned constraints. Unlike
current approaches that interpolate within training data, our models will
extrapolate meaningfully beyond their training distribution, mimicking human
creativity and scientific reasoning. Through systematic experiments across
physics simulation, language, vision, and abstract reasoning domains, we will
establish foundational principles for neural networks that can explore the
"adjacent possible" in a controlled, interpretable manner.

## 1. Background and Motivation

### The Fundamental Limitation

Current neural networks excel at pattern recognition within their training
distribution but fail catastrophically when asked to extrapolate beyond it. This
limitation represents a fundamental barrier to artificial general intelligence
and limits AI's utility in scientific discovery, creative design, and hypothesis
generation.

### The Human Cognitive Model

Humans routinely engage in "counterfactual thinking" - imagining worlds with
modified rules to explore ideas:

- Scientists ask "What if gravity were stronger?"
- Engineers wonder "What if this material had different properties?"
- Artists imagine "What if colors behaved like sounds?"

This cognitive ability to create "pocket realities" with selectively modified
constraints is central to human creativity, scientific discovery, and
problem-solving.

### The Research Opportunity

Recent advances in causal representation learning, physics-informed neural
networks, and compositional reasoning suggest that teaching neural networks to
perform controlled distribution invention is now feasible. This research will
establish the theoretical foundations and practical methods for this capability.

## 2. Research Questions and Hypotheses

### Primary Research Question

**Can neural networks learn to invent new, coherent probability distributions by
selectively modifying constraints from their training distribution?**

### Specific Sub-Questions

1. **Rule Extraction**: Can neural networks reliably identify and disentangle
   the causal rules governing their training distribution?

2. **Selective Modification**: Can networks modify specific rules while
   maintaining consistency in unmodified aspects?

3. **Coherent Generation**: Can the invented distributions maintain internal
   consistency and generate plausible samples?

4. **Insight Transfer**: Can insights from invented distributions be mapped back
   to inform understanding of the base distribution?

### Core Hypotheses

**H1**: Neural networks with appropriate inductive biases can learn to separate
causal mechanisms from their parameters, enabling rule modification.

**H2**: Progressive curriculum learning from interpolation to extrapolation
tasks will enable controlled distribution invention.

**H3**: Distribution invention capability will transfer across domains (physics,
language, vision) given appropriate architectural components.

**H4**: Models trained for distribution invention will show improved
generalization and interpretability compared to standard architectures.

## 3. Literature Review and Innovation

### Related Work

**Causal Representation Learning** (Schölkopf et al., 2021): Provides
theoretical foundations for disentangling causal mechanisms but hasn't addressed
creative rule modification.

**Physics-Informed Neural Networks** (Raissi et al., 2019): Incorporate physical
laws as constraints but are limited to known physics.

**Compositional Generalization** (Lake & Baroni, 2018): Studies systematic
generalization but within fixed rule systems.

**Neural Module Networks** (Andreas et al., 2016): Enable compositional
reasoning but require pre-specified modules.

### Key Innovation

Our approach uniquely combines:

1. **Causal disentanglement** for rule extraction
2. **Selective constraint modification** for controlled extrapolation
3. **Consistency enforcement** for coherent generation
4. **Cross-domain architecture** for general distribution invention

This integration enables the first neural networks capable of principled
exploration beyond their training distribution.
