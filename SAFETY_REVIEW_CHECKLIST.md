# Safety Review Checklist for Distribution Invention Research

This checklist must be completed at each major milestone and before any model release.

## Pre-Development Safety Review

### Experiment Design Phase
- [ ] **Identify Potential Risks**
  - [ ] What harmful outputs could this experiment enable?
  - [ ] Could results be misused for deception/manipulation?
  - [ ] Are there dual-use concerns specific to this domain?
  - [ ] Document all identified risks in experiment plan

- [ ] **Data Safety Assessment**
  - [ ] No personal/private data in training sets
  - [ ] No facial or voice data (deepfake prevention)
  - [ ] Verify data sources are ethically collected
  - [ ] Check for harmful biases in data distribution

- [ ] **Modification Boundaries**
  - [ ] Define hard limits on modification magnitudes
  - [ ] List prohibited modification types
  - [ ] Implement technical constraints in code
  - [ ] Document why limits were chosen

## During Development Safety Checks

### Weekly Safety Review
- [ ] **Output Monitoring**
  - [ ] Review sample of generated distributions
  - [ ] Check for unexpected/harmful patterns
  - [ ] Verify safety constraints are working
  - [ ] Log any concerning outputs

- [ ] **Code Safety Audit**
  - [ ] No hardcoded bypass of safety checks
  - [ ] Logging of all modification requests
  - [ ] Rate limiting implemented correctly
  - [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive info

### Training Phase Checks
- [ ] **Monitor Training Dynamics**
  - [ ] Check for mode collapse toward harmful outputs
  - [ ] Verify diversity of generated distributions
  - [ ] Ensure safety losses are weighted appropriately
  - [ ] Track any optimization instabilities

- [ ] **Checkpoint Safety**
  - [ ] Test checkpoints for harmful capabilities
  - [ ] Verify safety mechanisms remain intact
  - [ ] Document any capability jumps
  - [ ] Store checkpoints securely

## Pre-Release Safety Review

### Model Capability Assessment
- [ ] **Harmful Output Testing**
  - [ ] Run red team prompts for each domain
  - [ ] Test edge cases and adversarial inputs
  - [ ] Verify refusal mechanisms work
  - [ ] Document failure modes

- [ ] **Dual-Use Evaluation**
  ```
  For each identified dual-use risk:
  - [ ] Test if model enables this use case
  - [ ] Measure effectiveness of mitigations
  - [ ] Document residual risks
  - [ ] Plan additional safeguards if needed
  ```

### Technical Safety Validation
- [ ] **Safety Systems Check**
  - [ ] Plausibility detector accuracy > 95%
  - [ ] Harm detector false negative rate < 1%
  - [ ] Consistency validator working correctly
  - [ ] All safety thresholds properly calibrated

- [ ] **Robustness Testing**
  - [ ] Test with out-of-distribution inputs
  - [ ] Verify graceful failure modes
  - [ ] Check for safety bypass vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Stress test with high load

### Documentation Review
- [ ] **Safety Documentation Complete**
  - [ ] All risks documented in model card
  - [ ] Mitigation strategies explained
  - [ ] Usage guidelines clear
  - [ ] Contact info for reporting issues

- [ ] **Legal/Ethics Review**
  - [ ] Terms of service updated
  - [ ] Usage restrictions clear
  - [ ] Liability considerations addressed
  - [ ] Ethics board approval (if required)

## Deployment Safety Measures

### Access Control
- [ ] **User Verification**
  - [ ] KYC process for API access
  - [ ] Rate limits per user implemented
  - [ ] Usage monitoring active
  - [ ] Suspension mechanism tested

- [ ] **Content Filtering**
  - [ ] Input filters for prohibited content
  - [ ] Output watermarking functional
  - [ ] Detection tools developed in parallel
  - [ ] Audit trail complete

### Monitoring Plan
- [ ] **Real-time Monitoring**
  - [ ] Anomaly detection active
  - [ ] Usage pattern analysis
  - [ ] Automated alerts configured
  - [ ] Human review process defined

- [ ] **Incident Response**
  - [ ] Response team identified
  - [ ] Escalation procedures documented
  - [ ] Rollback plan tested
  - [ ] Communication templates ready

## Post-Deployment Review

### 30-Day Safety Assessment
- [ ] **Usage Analysis**
  - [ ] Review all usage patterns
  - [ ] Identify unexpected use cases
  - [ ] Check for policy violations
  - [ ] Update safety measures as needed

- [ ] **Community Feedback**
  - [ ] Collect safety concerns
  - [ ] Address reported issues
  - [ ] Update documentation
  - [ ] Plan improvements

### Ongoing Safety Commitments
- [ ] **Regular Reviews**
  - [ ] Monthly safety metrics review
  - [ ] Quarterly red team exercises
  - [ ] Annual third-party audit
  - [ ] Continuous improvement plan

- [ ] **Transparency**
  - [ ] Publish safety metrics
  - [ ] Share lessons learned
  - [ ] Engage with safety community
  - [ ] Update best practices

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Safety Incident
1. [ ] Immediately disable affected models
2. [ ] Notify safety team lead
3. [ ] Begin incident investigation
4. [ ] Prepare public communication
5. [ ] Implement fixes before re-enabling
