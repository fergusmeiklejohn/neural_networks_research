# Next Steps - Clear Action Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priority (Start Here Tomorrow)

### 1. Implement Meta-Learning Framework
Based on MLC paper insights from our literature review:

```python
# Location: models/meta_learning_framework.py
# Reference: COMPLETE_LITERATURE_INSIGHTS.md (Meta-Learning section)

# Key implementation:
- Dynamic task generation during training
- Different "physics worlds" each epoch
- Based on MLC's 99.78% SCAN success
```

**Action Steps**:
1. Read the MLC implementation details in `COMPLETE_LITERATURE_INSIGHTS.md`
2. Create `models/meta_learning_framework.py`
3. Adapt MLC's grammar-based approach to physics parameter generation
4. Test with simple physics modifications first

### 2. Add MMD Loss to Models
From CGNN paper insights:

```python
# Location: Update models/causal_rule_extractor_design.md implementation
# Reference: The MMD loss section we already added

# Key implementation:
- Multi-bandwidth RBF kernel
- Distribution matching loss
- Add to existing physics models
```

**Action Steps**:
1. Copy MMD implementation from `causal_rule_extractor_design.md`
2. Integrate into physics training pipeline
3. Weight MMD loss appropriately (start with 0.1)

### 3. Train and Evaluate Baselines
We have the framework ready, now execute:

```python
# Use: models/baseline_models.py
# Follow: EXPERIMENT_CHECKLIST.md

# For Physics Worlds experiment:
1. Load existing physics data (already generated)
2. Train all 4 baselines
3. Run unified evaluation
4. Generate comparison report
```

**Action Steps**:
1. Create `experiments/01_physics_worlds/train_baselines.py`
2. Import baseline models and configure for physics
3. Train each baseline (allow ~2 hours)
4. Run `UnifiedEvaluator` from `models/unified_evaluation.py`

### 4. Apply Representation Space Analysis
Verify true OOD based on materials paper insight:

```python
# Use: RepresentationSpaceAnalyzer from models/unified_evaluation.py
# Critical insight: Most "OOD" is actually interpolation!

# Steps:
1. Fit analyzer on training data
2. Categorize test data
3. Visualize with UMAP
4. Report true extrapolation percentages
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Reference Checklist

- [ ] Read meta-learning section in `COMPLETE_LITERATURE_INSIGHTS.md`
- [ ] Implement dynamic task generation
- [ ] Add MMD loss to physics models
- [ ] Create baseline training script

## ðŸ”— Key Documents to Reference

1. **For Implementation Strategy**: `COMPLETE_LITERATURE_INSIGHTS.md`
2. **For Evaluation Process**: `EXPERIMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
3. **For Baseline Details**: `models/baseline_models.py`
4. **For Physics Data**: Already in `experiments/01_physics_worlds/data/`
5. **For Safety Checks**: `SAFETY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`

## ðŸ’¡ Remember

- We're at 100% feedback integration - all foundations are in place
- Focus on Physics Worlds first (data already generated)
- Always compare against baselines
- Verify true extrapolation, not just statistical OOD
- Document progress in research diary

## ðŸš€ Expected Outcomes by End of Day

1. Meta-learning framework implemented
2. Baselines trained and evaluated
3. First comparison report showing our approach vs baselines
4. Clear understanding of true OOD in our physics data
5. Research diary entry documenting progress
